        "\n",
        "Literacy development is foundational for academic success, yet many K-12 students, especially in underserved areas, face significant barriers to accessing literacy resources. Alachua County has seen rising concerns over the adequacy of its educational support systems, particularly as they relate to literacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior research has primarily relied on qualitative coding to analyze interviews and survey data in literacy studies, providing valuable yet subjective insights. Recent advancements in text clustering present a less labor-intensive alternative that may enhance understanding by revealing emergent themes without pre-defined coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As access to literacy resources remains a critical concern in the context of educational equity, this study’s relevance is underscored by its potential to identify and categorize previously unobserved barriers. Using text clustering to examine these issues aligns with current efforts to harness machine learning in social sciences, filling a methodological gap by applying computational tools to qualitative education data.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, this study aims to explore the use of NLP technique  to analyze qualitative data from interviews with stakeholders on literacy resources in Alachua County, focusing on K-12 students. By applying unsupervised learning methods, this research identifies emerging themes related to available resources, access barriers, and unmet needs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Research in educational access and literacy resources has shown that economic, geographic, and linguistic factors frequently impede resource availability(Blanchard,2023). Studies(Korat,2005 andJavornik,2023)have demonstrated that traditional qualitative analysis uncovers barriers but requires significant manual labor and subjective interpretation\n",

        "Recent work in educational studies has applied nlp methods to large qualitative datasets (Nykopp,Maettunen& Erkens,2019), illustrating the efficacy of unsupervised techniques in identifying themes. Text clustering, specifically, has been recognized for its capacity to reduce researcher bias and handle large volumes of data with less manual oversight.\n",

        "To address the research questions effectively, I implemented a comprehensive workflow utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling techniques. These methods were selected due to their suitability for extracting themes and clustering semantically similar content from unstructured interview data. The combination of BERT-based embeddings, dimensionality reduction using UMAP, and clustering with HDBSCAN ensures that the methodology captures nuanced textual patterns while allowing for the exploration of latent topics within the data.\n",

So we do have a core set of materials that we use, but supplementing that or changing that as needed to meet what the learner needs. I think that is the most successful thing, to really just tailor it to the individual.',\n",

We provide a training before they begin working with learners and we provide some support materials for them to reference in case they need to. We're always here for them should they have any questions or issues. But as opportunities for development arise, we let our tutors know and invite them to participate.\",\n",
              " \"Well, we are a small organization and work with just a smaller number than maybe some other organizations do. We really check in with the learners, asking them how things are going for them and checking in with the tutors as well. We're really fortunate to have some really dedicated volunteers, and if they feel like they aren't making progress or things aren't going well, they're pretty quick to let us know to rectify the situation.\",\n",
              " \"I would say, working with adult learners that have learning disabilities. A lot of the learners that we work with are in this situation because they have some type of difficulty with learning whether it was diagnosed or not and it wasn't appropriately addressed when they were younger. So they've become adults with low literacy. I think that's one of the things that are more difficult to overcome without proper training.\",\n",
              " \"More effective? I would say, maybe most of our learning opportunities are virtual. That's just the nature of how things are. I think some of them would benefit from having some in-person training. They have the opportunity sometimes to interact in some of the trainings that they do have, but I think in-person would be beneficial for some folks.\",\n",
              " 'I would say, more time, which probably means more staff. When we\\'re fully staffed, there are only 3 people in my office, and we\\'re not often fully staffed. We\\'re not currently fully staffed. So I think more people and more volunteers. We\\'re actually going to try to do a little bit more marketing for volunteers because we know that there are many more learners out there than who contact us. We haven\\'t done a huge outreach for recruiting learners because I\\'m afraid we wouldn\\'t have the capacity to meet their needs if we did that, even though I know those learners are out there. I don\\'t want to be in a situation where we\\'ve gotten their attention and aren\\'t ready to act because I know it\\'s difficult for adult learners to take that step and say, \"I need to improve this.\"',\n",
              " \"How do we build the capacity? Through our training and through constant contact with our tutors and constant support. Actually, we're very fortunate to have a lot of our tutors be former teachers. They're usually retired teachers who just can't stay away, so they decide to volunteer. For a lot of them, they don't need much support as they’ve got a lot of experience and training. But for the ones who don't, we find that they come here with the desire to help and are pretty open if they run into a situation where they don't understand how to move forward or if things aren't working. So we just try to be as supportive as possible so that if a tutor does encounter that kind of situation, they feel comfortable approaching us, and we can help them right away.\",\n",
              " \"We do. We have been looking at family programs. We have done a couple for English language learners. We've done some family-related programs. We just really try to have open dialogue and conversations with our community partners and the individuals that we're working with. I think most people understand this is a group effort to get people where they need to be. So talking about it and engaging in that conversation.\",\n",
              " \"Well, we don't. The thing is, because we're working with adults, those adults are here because they've been failed. And usually that failure occurs earlier in their education. So we are interested and engaged in what's occurring in early education. We do work a lot, we table a lot, we go to events that are child-related, and we encourage and support literacy at all levels. We just try to let people know about what our services are.\",\n",
              " \"A lot of the referrals we get are because someone is interacting with them and has noticed that they are deficient in these skills. If they know that we're there, they'll send them over to us. As far as the public schools, because adults will contact the public schools to try to finish a high school diploma or something of that nature, we are in contact with them to let them know that we're here to help folks with that. We were also contacted not so long ago to share with parents what our services are in case the schools come into contact with parents who are in need of our services. So we do try to keep those contacts up.\",\n",
              " \"We table as much as we can at literacy events. For example, next week we're hosting an adult education provider round table where we'll come together. There aren't honestly a lot of programs for basic literacy adults; there are mostly programs for English as a Second Language (ESL) adults. Most of the providers there will be providers of English language instruction for adults, but we are also in contact with a few others who serve adults with basic education. So that's something we're doing next week. We are actively trying to be in touch with our community.\",\n",
              " \"I really feel like the heart of this lies with the school system. I have 3 kids in the school system, and my husband's a high school teacher. We're graduating kids or promoting kids from grade to grade when they should not be promoted. I know factually that is occurring. I've seen it, and we should not be doing that. We need to be giving them the assistance they need so that they can be going to the next grade prepared to be in that grade.\",\n",
              " \"There are things that can occur outside to support their literacy, but I really think that a successful intervention is going to be to stop that practice. We can't just promote kids because they're too old to be in their current grade. They need to be learning what they need to know to go to the next grade, and that means more money and staffing. I don't have the solutions to that—maybe better pay. These are big problems that can't be addressed by just one entity or one person.\",\n",
              " 'Providing supplemental programming at libraries, which is where I work and which is what we try to do, can help. But we really need to get on the formal education aspect.',\n",
              " \"I think education at school needs to be improved for all students. We should not be promoting students who aren't meeting the requirements of their grade level. I'm not suggesting that we fail everyone; I'm suggesting that when we identify those problems when they're in second grade, we start immediately remediating those problems in the second grade and continue until those problems have been remedied and they are prepared for the third grade. And then if in third grade they need more help, we need to have some structures in place that catch those students and stay with them if that's what they need.\",\n",
              " 'The school system.',\n",
              " \"They could... I mean, I'm not really familiar with the intricacies, but money and people—that's what they need. They need funding and staffing. I know there's always a shortage of staffing, and I don't know if that is because there's also a shortage of money or what the deal is, but they need to have enough people. We don't have enough teachers to provide the kind of instruction that I'm suggesting without overworking them.\",\n",
              " 'We need more people so that we do have enough teachers who can take a moment and say, \"You are having a hard time with your reading, or with your phonemic awareness, or with whatever the problem is. Let\\'s work on this every day until you don\\'t have this issue anymore.\" We need to have the number of people to be able to recognize it and then have the time to carefully instruct the child where they need the instruction.',\n",
              " 'Maybe they could create programs where university students are those extra people who can come in and help the students and provide that experience for the university students, but also provide that one-on-one support for the children who need it.',\n",
              " \"Community leaders could, you know, raise awareness. I don't know what all the details are at the moment; I don't know what parent engagement looks like. I do know, because we work with a lot of vulnerable populations in my office, that demanding more from people who don't have more to give is not a good answer. But I think general awareness is important. I talk to people pretty regularly who don't realize that literacy is such an issue.\",\n",
              " \"I also want people to think more about their community and not just their children. It's great if your children know how to read, but you want your neighbor to know how to read too, because that benefits you and improves your community. If you're worried about yourself, we need to phrase this in a way that appeals to that. It's to your benefit that the other kids know how to read too. So I feel like making it more of a community effort by talking about it more and raising awareness would be beneficial.\",\n",
              " \"I feel like people may not realize how prevalent illiteracy is and all the aspects of life that it bleeds into and affects. It affects healthcare, where our money is going, safety—it just affects everything. When people don't have the skills they need to be able to properly take care of themselves, it impacts everyone. It's really difficult for adults to gain those skills. We send kids to school every day for years, and then for adults to be in a position where they don't have those skills, it's very difficult for them to gain them. I would like to see our office not needed, to have to do something else because there isn't a literacy issue, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.\",\n",
              " 'I really think this is one of those places where prevention is much more efficient and effective than letting the problem continue until these folks are adults.',\n",

Here at our branch in particular, we have a very large youth attendance because we\\'re close to so many schools. But all of the library district branches provide a continuous level of programming like story time, music, and movement. Many sites, including our own, offer \"Read with a Dog.\" We participate with the Friends of the Library to present a story time to all the Head Start students in Alachua County. Each of the students receives a copy of that year\\'s selected book to take home and keep.',\n",
              " \"I would say all of our programming, even if it's indirectly, promotes literacy through reading instruction or other related activities. We have a 3D printer and art programs, and all of that requires some reading instruction. So even if it's indirectly, that learning is taking place.\",\n",
              " 'We also provide a space for after-school tutoring help. We used to offer one-on-one tutoring in-house with our own volunteers, primarily focused on reading literacy.',\n",
              " 'However, since COVID, we lost many of our older volunteers, so we no longer offer that. But we provide a space utilized by School Board tutors and private tutors. Additionally, our affiliation with the resource center next door, which makes us the Partnership branch, provides after-school homework help during the school year.',\n",
              " \"We do not offer as much adult literacy-based programming, although we have a basic computer class once a week that offers one-on-one instruction. Any help with literacy that the learner needs, we're here for that as well. Moreover, on a daily basis, all of the patrons that come in to use our technology, like computers, receive literacy assistance. Although the literacy component isn't necessarily always the primary component of what we offer, it's part of everything we do.\",\n",
              " 'We do a lot of training here. I guess it was maybe 2 years ago, a team of managers and I compiled a Youth Services training course. It was an 8-hour training course for programming from babies to teens. All of our programming staff had to go through the training, that was 2 years ago',\n",
              " 'The Florida Library Information Network offers trainings and workshops available to any staff, not just programming staff. We can have any staff attend any of those trainings or workshops. We have done competency skills testing in the past, though the last instance is a while back.',\n",
              " \"For any training or professional development, we utilize professional literature. Most of the programmers, I would say all of the programmers, are library specialists or above. Specialists need a bachelor's degree, and librarians in the library district have a master's in library and information science, providing them with the necessary training. Experience is also very helpful.\",\n",
              " \"If we have new staff, we pair them with experienced staff and don't throw them into programming on their own without guidance or training. I know that when I went through my programming training as a librarian, I was evaluated on my performance. I would do a story time, then my manager and I would have a conversation, and she'd give me instruction on what I could improve on and what was good. We do follow best practices developed through the American Library Association.\",\n",
              " 'Well, for early literacy, in developing early literacy skills, we follow the five best practices of including reading, writing, play, singing, and talking in all of our programming. We actually have a checklist for new programmers, and when they are being observed, more experienced staff will go through and check off when they notice the use of one of those five elements.',\n",
              " 'We follow those guidelines, and that really encompasses just about everything. As learners get older, we focus more on creative programming, steam programming, and using technology. For example, we have a recording studio here and try to get them involved in doing technology-based projects.',\n",
              " \"But that's assuming that the foundation has already been laid with a lot of these students. If it hasn't, and we can recognize that it hasn't, then we try to find the resources outside of the library that are available to students through the school district or through the resource center, such as after-school help.\",\n",
              " \"I mean, I think it's twofold. The thing that would improve my role and my staff's role here at this location—it's very specific to our location—would be more staffing. We're understaffed. And more resources. We are under-resourced.\",\n",
              " \"This whole community, like many under-resourced areas in this community, really besides the library, the closest other location that's free and available for children and teens after school is the Martin Luther King Center, which is several blocks away. It's a good walk\",\n",

Not that we don't get adults—our first half of the day is just all adults. I don't know if you've ever been here, but it's a very small building.\",\n",
              " \"But again, we get anywhere from 75 to sometimes over 100 kids crammed into the building. There's 6 staff, and so we do our best to provide the resources and services and provide programming, but we're understaffed and we're under-resourced， not us as much like we have a healthy budget. We can purchase things to do, crap to do our programs. But the community as a whole is under-resourced. Like I said, there aren't a lot of places for kids to get mentorship or have other outlets for after school to help with their learning.\",\n",

I also think it has to do with the fact that there aren't a lot of places to disseminate that information over here. I don't know how much non-school information is provided through the schools\",\n",

I work closely with our Friends of the Library to present our Snuggle Up and Read program, which involves story times at all of the local Head Starts and ensures that each student has a book of their own to take home.\",\n",
              " \"I also help coordinate efforts like our Teen Art Show and our Teen Writing Contest and ensure that all youth staff throughout the district are trained and have the same basic understanding of what we are doing in our youth programs here. I have been in this position since November of 2023, so I am still fairly new to this position and I'm still learning a lot. But I have been with the library district for 11 years, and all of that time, other than my couple of years of branch manager experience, I was a youth programmer. I worked with elementary-age and teenage patrons at our Code Park branch on the east side of Gainesville and did literacy programming with them. And then I also worked at our Partnership branch with youth.\",\n",
              " \"I really think that giving our learners a space to be creative, particularly for elementary age students and teens, to just be creative and try new things in a low-risk environment is vital. We're not giving them a grade; we're not evaluating. We're just giving them a place to explore different types of literacy and different ways to engage with literacy. I think that has really been helpful.\",\n",
              " 'When we are talking about our pre-literacy programming, as I mentioned before, we train all our library staff using the \"Every Child Ready to Read\" curriculum. We demonstrate to parents during our story times, baby times, and music and movement sessions how they can integrate those pre-literacy skills into everyday activities with their children. I think that has really helped our community become more confident in working with their children and preparing them for school and for reading.',\n",
              " \"We offer training and workshops. Part of the training involves learning from each other and demonstrating to each other the things we should be seeing in our youth programs. For all of our programs, we have a program evaluation form that we have our programmers fill out and then sit with their managers to review. This ensures that they are incorporating all of the elements we want to see in programs and that the program meets our level of expectation for what we're trying to provide for our community.\",\n",
              " 'We also allow all of our staff to attend professional development workshops and trainings through a variety of organizations, including NEFLIN, which is the Northeast Florida Library Information Network, and our professional organizations like ALA (American Library Association). We really encourage our staff to be creative, but we make sure they have the tools and knowledge necessary to work with our patrons.',\n",
              " \"I'm not sure, but I know that a lot of staff have been struggling since the pandemic with not having that personal training and the ability to network, work off of each other, and have those brainstorming sessions that we used to have. I would like to see us come back and do more workshop-type environments where we're together and learning from each other. I've seen that be very successful\",\n",
              " \"So, lots of money and funding to get more staff to be able to go and be in all of the places. One of the big things that we have tried to do here is not just focus our library programming on the library. We've tried to make sure that we are getting out into the community so that people can learn and know that we're here and see the things that we have to offer. But that takes money and staff. So, of course, it always comes down to that, doesn't it?\",\n",
              " \"But having more availability to go out and be a part of the community where they are and let them know about the things that are available to them is crucial. Some resources we can bring to them, and some they would need to come to us for. But it's really about educating them to let them know what's here\",\n",
              " 'We try and start with conversations and ideas. We invite our staff to have ownership in everything that we do and to bring their ideas to us so that we can work on ways to implement them. Once we have a good idea, we start training and workshopping, doing that peer-to-peer mentorship, and allowing staff the opportunity to feel like they\\'re supported in the things that they\\'re doing. Then we invite them to play. We always say, \"play is the work of children,\" but we all learn from it. So we allow them to participate and be a part of the things that we\\'re doing.',\n",
              " 'Here in Youth Services, everything we do is for families. When we do our story times, we make sure to engage the parents as well as the children, and we encourage them to participate in the programs we\\'re doing. We have a program here right now called \"1,000 Books Before Kindergarten,\" and we encourage parents through story time and other marketing throughout our branches to read with their children and participate, helping them prepare for school.',\n",
              " \"During the summer, we do our summer reading program, which is an all-ages program. This year we're really focused on making intergenerational connections. For example, with our discovery tracks, we invite participants to go out and try new things and discover new things. This year, we designed it so activities could be done as a family, and everyone earns the same reward for doing those activities.\",\n",
              " 'We always try to create opportunities for our community to come together.',\n",
              " \"One way we do that is through our Head Start program, Snuggle Up and Read. We visit all of the Head Start classes generally in the February-March timeframe, where we present a story time and the Friends of the Library provide a book for each of the students to take home. It's always one of my favorite programs because the youth are so excited to have a book of their own to keep.\",\n",
              " \"When we're not doing that, we also make sure that we are out in those communities supporting those institutions, not just Head Starts. We do outreach at Gainesville and all our branches go out into their local community to do story times at local childcare centers. At Cone Park, they take their monthly calendar over to the Eastside Community Center and invite the youth that participate in the city childcare program to come over and participate in all of the library programs.\",\n",
              " 'We try to go out into the community, be where they are, and bring the library to them.',\n",
              " \"We try to create partnerships where we can. We have a partnership with Partnership for Strong Families at one of our library locations—I believe you've already spoken with them. We also work with the Alachua County Children's Trust, and we have interns from the Youthworks program. We work closely with United Way and their reading initiatives; we are part of their Campaign for Grade-Level Reading meetings and participate in that. We participate in the Child Abuse Task Force and make sure that we are present and supporting their activities. We try to support other organizations in the community, and they support us as well.\",\n",
              " \"that's hard because reading has so much competition with other things. But I think we need to encourage people to explore literacy in ways that are fulfilling to them. For example, my son does not like reading; he hates it. It was always a struggle to get him to sit down and read, but when we discovered audiobooks, he loved that because he could do what he wanted while listening or follow along in his book. So we transitioned to using audiobooks even for his school reading. I get the audiobook for him, and he follows along in his book. So I think it's about finding the ways and expressing that it's okay, no matter how you choose to read. It's valid\",\n",
              " \"We’re all already doing so much. It's hard to come up with something concrete...\",\n",
              " \"I do feel that there are improvements that could be made. A lot of my experience is working at the Cone Park branch in East Gainesville, and many of the youth who came in were not coming in for books. They were coming in for our technology resources and other things. So I think having that role model, that example, that although digital literacy is important, so is reading, and so are the other activities we offer. If we could find a way to allow our youth to understand the importance of reading—it's something we talk about in schools, but how do you make reading cool?\",\n",
              " 'we got excited about 3 years ago. When we looked all over the planet and said, where is the most vulnerable citizen? And we fell in love with the early learning space from pre-k to kindergarten to 1st grade and you know, we designed an experience based on our last company. And so, you know, I spent over a decade in creating language development at the higher Ed level. We had a company that we started locally called Shadow Health and so, you know, that was really designed to prepare nurses to have better bedside language skills so they could have better interviewing skills.',\n",
              " \"And so when we sold that company to a veteran healthcare conglomerate, we reposition the same technology that we license from Uf in 2010, and we licensed a version of that for the early learning space. And so we were very familiar with the language space. But we didn't really understand the particular needs at the preschool level, because it's a completely different language need. So we literally sat in classrooms for over a year and saw what was happening from a user experience. And then we started reading about the science of reading and all of the different literacy gaps like the knowledge gap and just understanding the different. And then we had folks like Holly Lane that we were able to sit with and learn from her. huge scope of knowledge domain expertise in this area.\",\n",
              " \"And so from there we decided to. Okay. You know, there's this equation of word recognition, times, language, comprehension, equals reading, comprehension. And we thought we fit really well in this language side. So, what could that look like? And what evolved from there was? We made images. pictures, various pictures. and we asked the kids. okay, what these images were based on? Social study standards and so, we really took a dual content approach of trying to personify these standards of social studies so that they could facilitate a literary skill.\",\n",
              " \"And so it really allowed us to introduce narrative into the activities. And so, with an image. And some technology and a whole bunch of professional development. Around language oral language instruction. That's what birth asked me. You know.\",\n",
              " \"Great question we started off with the early learning space, all of the star standards for vpk, but then we also went to see palms and did all the K and 1st grade level standards as well, and then we because we had customers that were in Texas and New York. We ended up. You know, as you know, there's really 2 degrees of separation across the standards across the States. And so, we ended up just allowing those standards to evolve based on who was using it, where.\",\n",
              " \"So there's various uses. Some of our users position it in a morning hour, and they allow the kids to basically show and tell their questions around various topics. It's also used in a setting like the Holly Lane's 30-minute reading block around verbal reasoning and vocabulary. We designed a lot of our activities to follow that and facilitate background knowledge and vocabulary. We even hired directors from Sesame Street to help produce and direct 25 videos that personify each of the 25 social studies standards or the 4 strands. So we've allowed the process to really meet where the need was from a content perspective.\",\n",
              " \"this gives you a nice annual. This is our Pre. K. And so what you'll see here is theme. We have year one and year two, and we go through 15 assignments in each year. We have language and literacy standards, and social studies standards. Then we take you through your background knowledge, gather info, and then make meaning vocab knowledge. Each area that we're building from a skill perspective is first to gather information in week one and then make meaning in week two. We go through question stem words, verbal reasoning, and then literary skills and then communicating through some writing activities. We've tried to allow for these units to capture understanding citizenship as individuals, understanding people, places, and things around me in unit two, and then understanding citizenship through the environment.\",\n",
              " \"so we've mirrored our units with three different neighborhoods. Meville would be unit one. Each of these objects or individuals represent a different story, and I'll take you through one. Each of these would represent an assignment and they all have poems that introduce that particular area.If I were to go into week one, it would allow you to see a little more at the assignment-specific level, because we're still at the unit level here. Let's try a different window. If I were just to fast forward to show you the actual activity, here's where kids could learn nine story elements. If they didn't know anything about them, we would teach them by first pressing character. Questions are about the people and animals in the story.\",\n",
              " 'So this is one of 10 days of lesson activities. Let me pause there to give you a chance to react as to our user interface, or how this relates to scope and sequence, or how this relates to the health education standards of Minoland.',\n",
              " \"There's quite a bit of things that we include. A large aspect of it is what we built in the last year, which is one of our teacher tool kits. It's a pretty large volume. The larger goal was to make the environment a richer language environment. Our teachers were saying they understand the bigger goal but don't necessarily know how to facilitate or activate that. A large motivation for going in this direction and getting them things was so it wasn't just screen time, but things they could use to actually present to the kids. A large part of our instruction was around how better to increase the richer aspect of the language environment beyond just our activities.\",\n",
              " \"So last year we had a full district rollout. The district approved us, and we were in 20 something schools across VPK and first grade. We had a meeting with the superintendent on Monday as to how strategically he wanted to reuse us. We're waiting to hear. The data was super compelling in terms of the progress that the various schools, from an A school to a D school, and how their data was similar, which was super encouraging for us. We're waiting to hear back from the district as to what their preferred integration plan was for 24-25.\",\n",
              " 'The basis of our data comes down to a verbatim transcript that gets generated with every question and response.',\n",
              " \"So, every time a student would ask a question, our system through our virtual characters would have a verbal response. To track those conversational turns, our system captures it verbatim. That transcript is what we now tag our rubrics to. We can see how many questions fall into what rubric items. Over 3 years, we have 5 or 6 different ways to look at it, but we're still learning what is the best way to evaluate progress.\",\n",
              " 'Great question. So schools have used it somewhat differently. Some schools have used it in whole class instruction. Others have started there and then progressed into more of a small group depending on the particular cohort of that classroom and the particular needs. They would largely try to keep the whole group instruction, but then have certain populations put into a smaller group so that instead of them being able to participate in, you know, 15 or 20 total questions across 15-20 kids, now a small group of 4 would have 5 questions each.',\n",
              " \"So again, that's a great question because the reality is, and I'm speaking primarily about Alachua, they are using benchmark. A lot of our teachers have to use the benchmark to fill their ELA. We are being used as a supplement for the benchmark ELA. They are finding various time slots in addition to that 30 min. It might be 1 or 2 days a week in that time slot, another 1 or 2 days as a morning hour activity, and 1 or 2 days as a social studies activity.\",\n",
              " \"When you look at the Gallopade workbook, it is Alachua's core social studies for early learners and is relatively basic. Teachers have said we fit well to support the application or practice of the skills they are learning from other areas. Those applications don't really have a practice opportunity where conversation is the method of learning to apply vocabulary or background knowledge on these standards.\",\n",
              " \"This year there's been more conversation around using it to apply to the resiliency health education standards. Each Minoland citizen has a particular challenge to overcome to become a superhero, and that challenge typically falls within the health education, resiliency scope.\",\n",
              " \"And so we borrow against the scope and sequence of the 3 units.We've barred against those 3 units to introduce each of the neighborhoods that represent and make up Menoland.\",\n",
              " \"They mirror that. So Meeville would be learning about your citizenship through the first 5 assignments, and those would typically be. If there's an overarching theme, it would be, you know, responsibility. Right? So you have people of authority rules and laws. Responsible citizens some economic classes like needs and wants but then also, some other aspects of that, you know, social studies Strand, and then the other 10 assignments would be split across. The two other units. So a lot of geography base which is based on the environment in Unit 3, but then you got a lot of civics and history that would be in Unit 2.\",\n",
              " \"Well, it’s almost in, you know. Sometimes folks define things in the negative. So what I mean by that is, I think you this is not going to be a surprise to you. There's too much of curriculum. So that's been the largest communication to us. Right, which is, look if you look at the benchmark, Ela, curriculum. It's basically designed based on science and social studies content. But we're measuring literacy from it right? And so now you couple that with your social studies content. And so all of a sudden, you've got a ton of social studies. Content that you're using for different purposes. And so we now are being integrated on top of these. You know it. Large civic based. Content and. You know, the struggle is alright. What's gotta give right? And so what we're typically hearing is, it's some of the content is not being used. And so it's more a what can we do less with than it is? Oh, man, let me, I really need this. And so that hasn't necessarily been the ask. Because, like you, for the last 2 years, we've been conducting our larger needs assessment. And we've kind of done that to build the product experience.\",\n",
              " \"So, you know, I think we're very language centric. Because that's our 9 to 5, right? But even there, it's the conversation continues to be pretty consistent from a needs assessment. Hey? We love this help us find, you know, ways of integrating. And so every teacher at every school has been very creative. In how they've made all the pieces fit. Right? Cause it's not even just. They've got one, Ela curriculum. They've got to balance benchmark with you.\",\n",
              " \"I would rather leave that based on the circumstance of that district. Some districts have a greater need to develop more comprehension skills and find creative ways to include social studies. I have tried to create something that is dual purpose content. I don't necessarily need the preference of whether you put me in social studies or ELA. I am creating something focused more on how we are shifting. Teachers are doing 95% of the talking. I am trying to shift that legacy approach of teaching to say, let's get kids asking more questions, and let's get them more opportunities for conversational turns. That's really my heartbeat. Where you put me, I don't care. We fit in read-alouds, we fit in a lot of spaces. It's whatever empowers the agency of our learners and empowers our teachers on how to facilitate a different method of engagement through conversation. Whether it's social studies or ELA, I don't really care.\",\n",
              " \"So my heartbeat, and so oh. I'm not going to share the name of this group, because I don't think we're probably too early to share that. But there is an organization in town. That approached us in the last few weeks, and asked if we could lead an initiative for their parents. to facilitate our product at the home base side. And we said, absolutely. and so it. It's an initiative that again.\",\n",
              " \"For me it's always been the frontier right that the education system has not been able to bridge right is we know the distinction between a kid that walks into kindergarten ready. It has a lot to do. With what words are they hearing at home. What context are they being exposed to? Just high background knowledge versus low vocabulary.\",\n",
              " \"My hearts is I mean you, you know the baseball study about background knowledge. I would much rather try to make a generation of kids not. All of them are going to be academically high performers. But if I can get more kids familiar with concepts and world knowledge. I feel like I've done my part in this world right? Because if a kid knows about\",\n",
              " \"The major themes that drive life right like, how do I navigate economics. How do I navigate civics? How do I navigate? How does history give me some point of view of where we've been and where we shouldn't go again. I feel like we will prepare a generation to be a lot more productive citizens and responsible citizens. And so, you know, a large part of what we've spent a lot of time in is this approach to background knowledge? And it wasn't just from the literary research of, you know, like things like the rope. Right? We saw when we started doing some focus group testing in the classroom the kids responded so well to background knowledge activities that related to their real life. I'll give you one example?\",\n",
              " 'So in order to teach timelines, we ask kids two questions. What do you do every morning before you get to school? And what comes first? And so every kid in the classroom was able to say, Oh, I brush my teeth! Oh, I eat breakfast! Oh, I take the bus, and then we simply said as a follow up. which one do you do first? And and before we started introducing the standard which is so abstract. All of these kids were able to activate some prior knowledge of what they do every day to now make the standard their own.',\n",
              " \"And so, you know, we are super passionate about taking the abstract nature out of things with higher background knowledge. and allowing the words to become concepts that they can grow into life skills. And so like, the technology is really the tipping point for us, right? It's really a model for teachers to be able to transcend the conversational turns across the entire curriculum. And that's why, you know, when we were making the product, we picked social studies because we thought, Hmm, you know, for last 30 years nobody's thought about social studies. So something's wrong with that piece. But we knew it wasn't really about social studies. Social studies is such a rich content area that it forces you to internalize and say, Well, why? Why is people of authority, important like, or you know why, our needs and wants important, you know, and every kid can walk away with the theme of one of our activities or our assignments. Because it has a concept, life skill that they're going to use outside the classroom. And we get to introduce that in an academic way. So like, that's the perfect marriage between life skills and academic talk.\",\n",
              " \"So that gets us fired up, because that's kind of the home run for me of early learning.\",\n",
              " \"t's something that I constantly challenge myself in asking. I do believe that there has to be. We have these kids for such a small portion of their day and the other components of what makes a community thrive is where we need to lock arms with. And so there needs to be an intentionality about. So let me give you anecdotal. So the last company that I had right. I never wanted the work environment to be in a silo. And so what did we do? We found ways of doing life together right? And so whether it was, every other weekend somebody's responsible for making a some kind of new meal, and then we all would again go over that person's house. or we would find ways of playing sports together as a company. you know. Whether it was team, you know, corporate softball. Or, again, whatever it was, soccer. And what is that? What's the takeaway from that? In this setting we have to come up with a interconnected community. and if the community doesn't thrive. the education system will never thrive. So therein lies my heartbeat. It's the community has to be the priority. and how to lock arms. It has to start with the parents. And so the parents in my mind is that. But we haven't figured out an incentive beyond them doing homework right? And that's not it's it doesn't meet the threshold of engagement. Right? We have to stop thinking like, educate us and start thinking like humans again. and the humanity will prevail, and it will lend itself to us! Becoming a community. I don't think we're a community today. I think we are silos of aspirations. When we start. Thinking more in terms of how do. how does the community win? That's when we'll start making the right decisions about how education improves. So it takes different stakeholders and different approaches. It has to start in the classroom. but it can't stay there, and I think that's where our challenge is we keep. We keep such a singular linear mindset in terms of what is the way forward. And the only answer is community. If the community doesn't prosper. no school or kid prost was.\",\n",
              " \"I think it's more evident here than other districts that I'm in. and I think it has a large thing to do with. We've got a lot of professor kids right? And so there's a high academic gap of performance. And now you're comparing that to kids that come from different social economic experiences. And so the gaps more visible in Alachua than any other district I've ever seen or worked with. And it's because you've got super highly educated and super undereducated populations. And so it's just the chasm is magnified here. You know what a microcosm of it is. and this is probably the most politically incorrect thing I can say, but it is what it is. walk on the campus of Lincoln Middle School. And and see the night and day the kids don't mingle. They don't talk to each other, they don't have anything in common. and it is. It is unfortunately a microcosm of our community. You know. My daughter was a part of it, and she recognized it and said, Dad, I don't want to stay here. and it had everything to do with how disconnected the population was.\",\n",
              " \"So you know. We've got, and every school has a version of Lincoln right? And so you see it fan out into every education system. It's just more prominent there because kind of reaches a tipping point because it's a middle school.\",\n",
              " \"Yeah, so I'm gonna take a reach. Thought about something that I have not really communicated before. But your conversation kind of sparked something in my mind. So you know, being in the healthcare education field for quite a bit.\",\n",
              " \"I came across a larger thought. Leadership that was very similar to this conversation. and that was around there was a performance gap that existed in healthcare and there was a school of thought that was birthed in Harvard Business School back in the seventies. That introduced this concept of value-based healthcare. And it was in response to how fragmented healthcare is and why it was so expensive. And the premise was basically when we typically go into healthcare. We see a primary provider. and then 6 months later. We may have to see a specialty physician for some other system, cardio or respiratory, and then another year later. We have to see another specialty provider. And so that's 3 times the cost to that one patient. So what Harvard Business School came up with was. what if we took those 3 providers. and we made them meet with that patient on the front end of their patient visit and said, Hey, what would you say? Based on the history of this patient's workup? What would you suggest? The need is right now from a diagnosis. And what happened as a result was that the patient recovery time shortened because their outcomes accelerated And the patient didn't have to come out of pocket 3 times for 3 X-rays every time they went to a different specialty specialist. And so I guess what I'm coming up with. If you back this up now to what we're trying to achieve in the education space from a literacy standpoint to a large part. What you're doing, even with this Lastinger, you know, children's trust needs assessment. Right is mirroring a value-based approach because you're bringing the providers, if you will, that make up the network of our community and saying, hey? You know. what should we do? Different? How should we think about the problem of the student that needs to now reach their potential? And I think what you could do to accelerate this research is tap into what the Cleveland clinic. How the Cleveland clinic responded to value-based healthcare. And what they've done in the last 20 years is is remarkable. And I think anecdotally, you will learn much more around. how a provider took this out of the box approach that's non-medical and applied it in a medical term. and had significant, you know, patient outcomes that would have never been achieved under the current healthcare model. And I think that's what education is ripe for right now we need non educators to come and give us. You know, a point of view that because we're so myopic. you know, all we're thinking of is demographics and performance and reading. that we're not stepping back and saying, You know, like the 1st meeting that I attended for you guys. What I noticed was. There wasn't anyone in any of the surveys that talked anything around language. It was always all simply around reading. And I thought, Well, I wonder why these guys aren't having any conversations around language.\",\n",
              " \"Comprehension! And it seemed like the study was largely limited to a more linear our point of view of reading. But again, I didn't know enough at that point, cause I'm I'm 2 meetings in that. I didn't want to raise my hand and share too much, because I was still trying to figure out what this study was about, and the scope. And what what's the you know when you guys said potential.\",\n",
              " \"And the only last thing I would say is, you know, I wasn't sure if you guys were spending any thought process around the active view of reading literature. You know, Nell Duke introduced this active view of reading, documentation and analysis that it's added a lot more of the social skills, all the executive function and other aspects that is so critical. And that's why we went back to the drawing table over the last year I had the Providence to have email, Nell Duke. And she actually responded. And I was like. you know, like she's like my hero, like I'm I am so nerded out by, you know Nell Duke and I had an hour to talk to her just about how she thinks about where we are and what policy should look like. And in the short of it is. I'm only saying that not to name drop it. It was just it was more a matter of me trying to understand. What role does the social skill play in this reading piece? And where are the overlaps between. you know, word, recognition, and language that we're not even in conversation with. And so yeah, just so much that I get excited about these needs assessments. But I also know there's a practical side. That I can't be too geeked out with, and so I've  just kind of kept my mouth shut.\",\n",

And here's another thing that I wasn't quite sure the study was on, it looked more like we were on the learner population, the learner side versus the Pd. side.\",\n",

Hey, I own that right? Like, that's my feedback. That's not the kids feedback. It kind of points to how much are we reemphasizing what is our methods of teaching the teachers. right.\",\n",

This is not as feasible in a classroom setting.\",\n",

The child has to answer questions, write certain responses, and verbally share feedback. We also receive input from counselors and teachers from constant interactions. Once a child is matched with their Big, we get even more information, giving us a holistic view of the child's development, a significant part of which is their educational standing. This allows us to hone in on that area effectively.\",\n",

We consider the expectations that the parent has for the child, because that information gives us a window into the household's perception. Where the child wants to go and where they're currently focused are important because reading is essential to everyone, regardless of their goals. Whether they want to go to college or have a trade, everyone needs to know how to read. If a child is struggling with reading, it's the tipping point to everything else.\",\n",

The enrollment process is crucial because if we see a youth, whom we call Littles, has a deficit in reading, we can tailor our support accordingly. Whether or not a child has a desire to read, we still work with them and approach it strategically.\",\n",

If we have a teenager who is enthusiastic about a movie, we might use a book related to that movie as an incentive. If a child is more reluctant, we have to be strategic in engaging them. This understanding also helps us find the right Big for the Little, ensuring the mentor has the skills needed to address the child's specific needs.\",\n",
              " 'One challenge is that people sometimes get frustrated because they want a Big like tomorrow, but the matching process takes time.

Then the load will lighten up, they'll be able to focus on that additional support, and then the load will get heavy again.\",\n",

Of course, transportation needs to be considered, but behavior issues in classrooms are increasingly causing problems, making it hard to make progress throughout the day.\",\n",

We also try to kind of promote parent involvement and kind of encourage them to continue reading at home. With the kids as well. So within little sparks that's really kind of the tools that we use.

You know my team leads the way for the implementation in the museum, and then we try to hand it off to our educator staff is our weekend staff that leads those programs. So we have internal training. And in those trainings we try to have them kind of like workshops. Where we talk about scaling, you know. this program is specifically 0 to 5. But what if older sister, older brother comes? So we talk through that. We also try to mimic and and kind of showcase how we would, you know, read a story, or do some of these activities with the child at different age, you know 0 to 5. There's a lot of different skills that are kind of achieved, you know within that time period. So really comes down to our internal internal training and kind of learning from our guests and the children that we also see something about us, and I think Patty will find this true is we're constantly learning you know how to improve our implementation. You know, making sure that we are achieving goals and efforts, you know, for the county and the kids that we see, but also just for our staff, and just constantly learning what our guests enjoy and what they find is helpful to use with those children in that program.\",\n",

But we do have an admission fee. but we continue to see that program grow, and we would love to also be able to take. And you know in tangent with Patty what Patty is doing, but also take the in museum program out to the community, too. so you know, funding and staffing efforts for programs like that, I think, would be a big help. You know, I think we have a formula that we feel like is working. And hopefully, it's making an impact. Although we're constantly learning and making edits based on what we see.

So that's one of the ways that we can encourage them back to us. But like I mentioned, we have tried and have had Gainesville thrives. Come to the Museum for sign ups for Dolly, Imagination library, their book program. and just trying to continue with our interactions with the parents.

Patty visits the schools with Kate in the classrooms as well as some of our other K teachers, and then they also we also facilitate in museum visits. About once a month on a field trip day on an early release Wednesday.

We're in their monthly kinda update meetings for that area. So it's kind of just our relationships and maintaining our relationships with our staff. Patty has a strong relationship with these groups that she goes out and sees and you know, my team is able to help kind of maintain some of those relationships through our partnerships and tabling efforts. You know you'll find us at the library at their homeschool kickoff. You'll find us at other outreach efforts. We were just at the 4th of July event for the Children's Trust of Gainesville.

And I'm familiar with a lot of you know I was. I'm in education, you know, all the time that was what I studied. So I'm kind of aware of methods and things like that. So I work my best to do my best to practice those efforts with my daughter. But, you know that can't be expected of every parent. So also having resources for them to kind of, you know. Hey? You know, reading to your kid every day, even if it's just a quick, short book that's helping them learn new words. You don't realize it, but they're hearing those words and exposes them to more words. So I think that could be a layer that could be helpful.

How do you put stem into a 3 and 4 year old scope of vision? How do you do that, and we did. We figured it out. We wrote it, we put it together, and it could be something as simple as the lifecycle with caterpillars and butterflies to understanding volcanoes and rocks. It is anything is on the table, whatever they want to learn. And you put the words in, and the letters and the numbers. We don't read storybooks to them. They want more hands-on with episcopal children's services. They want the children to roll up their sleeves and put things together. listen to sounds and watch sound waves in action, or the mere fact of fanning a piece of paper and watching the wind, that they're making carry a pinwheel to move.

And actually, I read it in a study, you know, when you don't sleep at night you read some off-the-wall studies. and I just wanted to try it. I thought, why not? And I've been kind of putting it out there, and it is fun. But I would love to see something with adult literacy. Because if you can read, you can do anything. And unfortunately, parents aren't reading to their kids at night just simple story books just simple things. My husband. I remember when our boys were younger. They're 30 and 32, but when they were little after dinner they'd be, you know, 6 months old, sitting in the lap, and he would read the sports scores. and you know it was so funny. And I said seriously, and he said, Well, this is how we learned the love of baseball, and he would read the box scores, and they would have pictures, you know, in the paper, and he'd say, See this guy? He can't play well now these are his scores, and he would read it out, and I remember watching our sons just look up at him like sure.\",\n",

And my husband did that as a very, you know, at an early age my parents didn't read to me much, because they were always busy, it seemed. but I had immigrant grandparents. who had 6th grade educations when they came over, and my grandparents were very instrumental about learning, and they would read like to me. Nancy drew books, and then I would have to read to them. Nancy drew books and the hardy boys that were my dad's when he was little. and I think if parents instill it, or grandparents, they do it together. I would love to see some just music and movement and and reading with kids. We need those programs. Unfortunately, it does take what's the word, Carmen. Lots of money.\",\n",

We all have these talents, we all, you know. Let's not. Let's not work against each other. How can we conquer this problem? Conquer the city? I mean, these are, gonna be grandiose ideas. But post all over, you know, we could have a reading Saturday. for instance, once a month the Cade Museum is hosting this, the library, this library is hosting. Whatever group another group peak literacy, is over at whatever. And could you imagine we could develop county for reading? And it's always known the 1st Saturday of the month we have reading Palooza all over the city, and we try it. And would it cost a lot of money? Not really. I think it's doable. I know it's attainable. but we just. spearheading of it, and I'm going to tell you it wasn't just me. Green Bay, Wisconsin is trying to do something like this right now with one of my old colleagues, and she said, It's just getting everybody together without them feeling like it's an ulterior motive or something. We need to do it pure of heart and say, there's a problem. We're creative. Let's solve it and have a map where you want to be. That's just my simple idea. Carmen.

Let's do this one in the morning and this one in the afternoon, and have a reading day with your kid, with art and science. And reading Palooza, which is hosted by the libraries in Deepa Park that was in June. It just so happened to align with our Community Day, where we open the museum for free, and we got a lot of groups that were of reading Palooza come over to the Museum.

If needed, I can go through our survey responses for more specific information on impacts like learning about financial aid or applying for college earlier.\",\n",

Well, I think the curriculum is great, but without guidance, I think curriculum paired with the coaches to help with knowing how to implement the curriculum is the best that has worked. Giving a curriculum without guidance means they may not know how to implement it with fidelity. When you're being intentional and want to drive your data, pairing coaches with the curriculum is advantageous.\",\n",
              " 'For example, with coaching on Creative Curriculum or any chosen curriculum like Frog Street, it has been beneficial to implement that coaching piece to guide teachers in understanding their numbers and data. After PM period 1, when we test our students and look at the data, the coach reviews it and shows teachers how they can use the curriculum to drive positive outcomes.',\n",
              " \"So, the best thing is not just the curriculum but the curriculum paired with coaching, professional development, and guidance, especially when looking through the lens of class tools. That's what really helps.\",\n",
              " \"Well, each curriculum that's on the list, our coaches are trained for. The provider has the option to choose a coach, and we give them that option. The coach then meets with them, looks at their classroom, gives them best practices, models with them, and looks at their data—all around what's going on.\",\n",
              " 'It\\'s not just about behavior. Most of the time when a classroom thinks they have behavior issues, it\\'s actually not a behavior problem. I observed a classroom yesterday where the teacher called me to check out a behavior issue, and I had to tell her, \"This has nothing to do with the students and everything to do with you.\" There was no schedule, the students didn\\'t know what to do, there were no transitions in place, and a lot of learning time was lost. I was there for about two and a half hours, and not one book was read to the students. When I told her at least 8 to 12 books should be read in a day, she was amazed.',\n",
              " \"So, when we're talking about coaching and curriculum, those who choose to coach—whether it's practice-based coaching, which we do here and really love—find it beneficial. Our coaches are trained to go out with all the curriculums, to help teachers make lesson plans that are going to drive their numbers.\",\n",
              " \"I wish they could address and adapt more on classroom management. That's the key. Even when I was a preschool teacher, once your classroom is managed—meaning you have an engaged class—you are able to teach. But without that classroom management, without knowing how to engage students, it becomes challenging.\",\n",
              " 'I don\\'t think they should call it classroom management anymore; I say they should call it classroom engagement. When students are busy with jobs, they don\\'t have time for behavior issues. I told a teacher yesterday, \"They have no jobs. You need a teacher\\'s helper, someone to hold the door, someone to set up the classroom.\" If you have alphas inside the classroom, utilize them because when their minds are busy, so are their hands. In my classroom, everyone had a job, and the busiest ones had the most jobs because they\\'re capable of doing multiple tasks.',\n",
              " 'Teachers often say, \"Oh, since COVID, these children are different.\" I don\\'t think they\\'re different in a fundamental way; maybe they need more engagement. Nowadays, cell phones and other technology engage students in many ways, often negatively. How can we transform that into the classroom? How can we utilize technology not just as a babysitter? I see classrooms where the TV is on as background noise, and very little learning is taking place.',\n",
              " 'So, focusing on engaging your classroom is crucial. Another important topic is utilizing outside play for learning. I went to a great institution this summer, where the speaker taught us that at least 8 to 12 books should be read each day. She showed us how to incorporate reading into transitions, like at the beginning and end of outside playtime.',\n",
              " \"Utilizing outside play as a learning opportunity is essential because some students learn best in the sunshine and while running around. Teachers could be doing one-on-one instruction, teaching colors, exploring with students, and engaging in language modeling and conversations. Some students respond incredibly well to the outdoor environment, and it's crucial to harness that.\",\n",

This includes students who have been moved from classroom to classroom due to disruptions.\",\n",
              " 'The greatest need is having someone who can help teachers understand inclusion and how to include a student who is truly autistic or has developmental milestones they are struggling with.

First, you need to implement visual aids, pictures, and other tools to help that child understand and become part of the classroom.',\n",

And our students come from mostly minority backgrounds. So we have first-generation college students, first-generation Americans, African-American students. And those aren't the only students we serve. We're not exclusive to those groups. But those are the people who have sought out our organization. So it's who we've been helping the most.\",\n",

We're also trying to get into some churches to reach out to youth groups. We are seeking out students everywhere and anywhere we can.\",\n",
              " 'When it comes to literacy specifically, I think for applying to college and the ACT, these students do have a good level of literacy strong enough to get them through the college admittance process. The more complex answer would be that thinking about their skills in all of their education and then getting into college is one thing, and how they will perform in college when they get there is a separate topic.',\n",

We try to prepare them for that in our College Pass program, talking about the difficulty level in college and what's going to change about the courses so students can prepare for that change. A lot of students come to us in their senior year in a bit of a panic mode because they really want to get into college. We try to figure out what we can do for them to get them to college, and we've had a 100% college acceptance rate so far. Every student has gone to college. We try to follow up with them as best we can, and most report that they are doing fine. Anyway, to sum up my answer, because I've been talking long enough.\",\n",

I'm actually going to drop our website in the chat before I forget.\",\n",

But we do follow up a year after our program. For example, the students who completed our College Pass program in 2023 to 2024, we call them in about May to talk about how college is going, how their first semester went in the fall, and how the spring semester is going. We try to follow up with them as best we can.\",\n",

But many of the skills we talk about in our program can help students with their literacy, especially in SAT or ACT prep, where we talk about how to read certain passages because you need those reading comprehension skills. Exercises like that can help. We write progress logs and ask students to discuss their progress. These exercises can help students convey how they're feeling and learn how to talk about themselves. The SAT, ACT exercises can help too.\",\n",
              " 'Definitely.',\n",

Many have the skills but lack the motivation to go to college or don't think they can do it. So a lot of what we do, in addition to the actual help, is motivating them and empowering them to achieve what they want. We have panels of speakers. This Friday, for example, we have the national recruiter for the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars coming to speak to students.

We have people who have been in education for quite some time looking at their essays and engaging with them as well.',\n",

All of our students are required to complete the FAFSA as part of our program. The first week of College Pass, last Friday for us, was they take an ACT to have a benchmark because some of these students have never taken one before. We establish a benchmark with them: \"This is where you\\'re at. Where do you want to be, and what amount of work is required to get there?\"',\n",
              " \"Yes, we have ways to measure their progress so that at the end of the year when they're finished with their senior year and moving on from the Education Equalizers, we could talk about their progress in terms of the amount of scholarships they have$100,000 worth of scholarships.\",\n",
              " \"I think the number one thing I would say is for ESL. It would be really helpful for our staff to receive some training in how to deal with students in ESL. For me, it's very easy because I speak Spanish, so I just speak Spanish with them, and we work through all the college application stuff in Spanish. Of course, they have to write their essays and take the ACT or SAT in English, but it's much easier to walk them through the instructions in Spanish. For me, that's easy, but a lot of our staff might struggle because they don't know Spanish and might not know how to explain certain things to ESL learners.\",\n",

Obviously, of course, we've had mostly juniors and seniors complete our program so far, some sophomores sometimes, but juniors and seniors are the main people, because, you know, they get to that last stage of high school, and they realize, -oh, I need a lot of catch-up to do if I want to go to college.\",\n",
              " \"Of course we help them with that. But we would like to see more 8th graders, because if we could get students earlier and keep them for their whole high school career, starting 8th grade and moving up 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, we could really help them and achieve a lot with them. Our director always likes to say every 8th grader should take the SAT. She's really onto that. They should take the SAT or ACT and should start figuring out the cost.\",\n",

Kids K through 12 come here, and are evaluated for different reasons, and I compile the information, the results of their background history, and the results from those evaluations and come up with a plan of ways to support their family and teachers in evidence-based practices in 13 districts. So I work all through North Central Florida, including Alachua County. For Swag, I am a board member and I was part of the team that developed their summer program.

You know, I share the resources, and we don't always reassess necessarily after those resources are shared. I will get feedback of progress at times, like teachers will send me standardized test scores or things like that, or anecdotal things or families will send me that, but I don't know that it's directly related to those particular resources.\",\n",
              " \"I think I'm okay. For Swag, we did some training for the teachers for the summer program, and we based that primarily on UFLY. So we did some beginning of the program testing to see where kids were. We showed the teachers how to tailor that information, take that information, use UFLY to be very targeted in their instruction, because they only have 2 weeks with these students, and they were all primarily struggling readers.\",\n",

But what I did see is a lot of the kids gained confidence, and they knew the process a little bit better. I think just even gaining that confidence, I could see a little bit of an increase in their capacity to attend to the task. So that's more what I would say. I don't know that they're hugely better readers in 2 weeks with 2 hours a day, 4 days a week. Maybe it's a little more frequent than that. But I do think it gave them a structured program, and it did give them some supports in other ways too.\",\n",

Following up on that summer program for the tutoring program, I met with a team, and we thought out some ways to structure the program and provide some supports, and some ways to target the literacy aspect. I met with the educational person who works there and talked about some diagnostic tools and structure to a very short amount of time with very little hands on deck. They were going to use that information to help train the volunteers who were coming in.\",\n",

Those are some tools that we use\",\n",

We put all that information on a profile graph, as Amy mentioned, and we use those scores, the overall picture of that child as a learner, or how they function in a classroom to inform our recommendations. Follow up back to those evidence-based recommendations. All of our recommendations are based on evaluation. We get a lot of history about a child. We take a lot of time to compile every aspect of the information we have with the evaluation scores to make sure we encompass all the areas and make our recommendations based on all that information together.',\n",

So I don't feel like I can answer for them. Maybe I could follow up and ask Stephanie, who does implement everything, what that looks like.\",\n",

They usually go to the summer camp before, so they funnel right in because attendance is sometimes an issue in that community. They want to make sure the time and resources are being utilized. So that's a standard they use. I think it's a work in progress.\",\n",
              " \"That diagnostic piece was not always there, and the post-testing was not always there. I think it was less developed in other years. Speaking of this past year, using those things and basing the instruction on those very targeted areas, because it's such a short amount of time, is a standard that I think will continue to happen. I would say, because the program only started in 2020, it's been a work in progress. I think we're getting there for having more standards and more of a procedure of things.\",\n",
              " \"Orthography and morphology, for... I find, and ways to support second and beyond early readers, that they are actually going to buy into and are implementable within the structure of a secondary school day.

Swag is doing a really great job this year, so that educational person partners with all the schools that serve that community and gets information from those schools. They share information so she can really support them. I would say the language piece for Swag, for sure, and maybe some evaluation that they could do there so they could help the kids get access to the resources or be identified with the learning issues they might or might not have.\",\n",

Some training on different evaluations and different learning neurodiversity type things would be helpful. But yeah, I think just being able to hire another person to do the educational piece at Swag. She works for Swag, but she also works a few days at the Child Center and visits schools a day a week. That's very little time to devote to the tutoring program, the planning of it. The volunteers are inconsistent. I think probably consistent training for volunteers is needed, so they have to go through some training and actually know how to implement the things that will help the kids.\",\n",
              " \"MDTP program, we are doing the LETRS training right now. So I would say that's pretty supportive of that. We have a lot of resources here that are accessible to us. So I think that's how they build our capacity.\",\n",
              " \"The Swag piece, I think that’s probably an area of development. Even meeting with Stephanie, who's doing this role, I did by my own accord, like I just was like, I'll help her do this. There's not a ton of capacity building, I don't think. She is an educator, but it's very different being an educator in a classroom and then doing targeted instruction to kids, especially for a short amount of time.\",\n",
              " \"In my role in MDTP program, I support the families and the schools. I meet with them, and I provide support in some of the activities. If I recommend something to them, I try to have a follow-up with them and see if they implemented it, if they need support implementing it. So that's kind of me. And then if they need school-based support in that area, I make that connection.\",\n",
              " \"For Swag, again, small program. I'm not quite sure if that's developing at this point.\",\n",
              " \"I am the Alachua County person here for MDTP program. I reach out to the schools where I have a child on my caseload. So I initially reach out to the schools and offer collaborative consultation. Through that, I've developed relationships with different schools in Alachua County. That's really it—collaborative consultation. I get some opportunities to be in classrooms and sometimes support in IEP meetings or other things like that.\",\n",
              " \"For Swag, it's those days that Stephanie is going to the schools. The schools are invited every time they have a back-to-school event, a family night, or something like that. The schools that serve that area are always invited to be represented and keep that connection with those children and the community. The center itself, and then she is going there, I think, at least once a week—not to each school once a week, but to one of the schools once a week—to find out how they can support each other. That's a new piece, and I think it's a really, really good one.\",\n",

Because of this unique situation, I did get the opportunity to establish a partnership between MDTP program and Swag this last summer, but I don't know if that will happen again because we have a very small team, and it's a pull on our resources. We couldn't do it in all the districts we serve; it's just not possible.\",\n",

              " \"Yes, you're right. And then the other organizations, they have to be literacy-based because we also like CARD and CAN. And thinking that through, yeah, CARD, CAN, we don't say who, but a speech and language pathologist, follow up with them, or sometimes LIPS, some of those multimodal programs. So through MDTPP program, we kind of try to... they don't necessarily partner, but we use those as resources.\",\n",

I think training for that language piece that I wasn't really aware of till I moved into this position is essential. Understanding how ADHD and different neurodiversities impact learning is critical. I'm not sure teachers in our community or any community are supported adequately in that growth area. For a lot of struggling readers, identifying those neurodiverse needs and using best practices to support their learning would probably help the community quite a bit.\",\n",

Because of the contract with Children's Trust, if we were to provide the services to those organizations as they request them, it would exhaust all of our funded sessions. Our biggest impact, I think, is during the summer camp time, when we're able to work with these children during out-of-school time.

Many times, if we are effective in reaching the child, it becomes more of an issue or desire for the child. Sometimes the parents would entertain it and be open to trying something different.

              " 'We do technology workshops, classes, seminars, events. The majority of our audience is K through 12. So we primarily teach how to use technology, ways that you can incorporate technology into your career, showing kids how to use a computer, a mouse. But also, really more than that, is how to do graphic design, how to do 3D printing, 3D design, coding, and robotics.',\n",
              " \"And then we've introduced storytelling and brought in Mr. Dominic. He can give you his background, but primarily because we wanted to include this storytelling aspect. Whether, on my side, I'm more of a visual storyteller, and he is more of a literary. So we wanted to kind of infuse that into our program rather than just, you know, showing how you can use technology but really, how you can use it to tell stories and kind of just opens up a lot more opportunities.\",\n",
              " \"So just to make it really clear, our focus is technology. But we do bring in this literacy component. And so as we build our organization, that's kind of where we're at at this phase. We began in 2016, so we’re not, you know, a long history with this environment of teaching technology in the educational space, but we're not brand new. And we have had funding, so we feel like we're in a growth phase right now.\",\n",
              " 'Yes.',\n",
              " \"Well, because, you know, we're in a lot of different meetings. We were part of the children's trust. We're also part of United Way; they have the campaign for grade level reading. And so we worked with Reading Pals and actually partnered with them. That kind of started us thinking that we needed to include a lot more literacy into our program. We would provide the technology, and then they were bringing some of the activities that were more focused on reading and literacy.\",\n",
              " \"Then we brought Mr. Dominic in and felt like we could expand on what we'd kind of learned from working with United Way and with his experience, just coming up with different research on where we could find ways to enhance all of our programming. Like I said, we're growing, and so we started out with basics. But we just wanted to create a more robust program where we were kind of hitting a lot more targets at the same time.\",\n",
              " \"Particularly since we go into programs that are lower income, or rural, or maybe not getting as much exposure and access to technology. We just felt like we're bringing the technology. But why not work on these issues that a lot of people in our area—which it’s become very evident, especially when we go into classrooms—really lack attention. And so we just feel like we're trying to help as much as we can while we're there.\",\n",
              " \"Well, I probably should give you a little bit of background first. I have a Master's of Fine Arts from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. That was my first master's, my second master's from the University of Maine is a Master of Science in education. It's a research degree. I would not have been able to do any higher education if, in fact, the storytelling component of my life, and where I came up—I'm a second-generation Spanish, Basque and Irish on both sides. Second generation, and storytelling was basically what I was surrounded with.\",\n",
              " \"I also came from a fairly restricted background financially. One of the stories that I often tell is how the first pencils I had to write for school were these little stub pencils that my father had left over from business. So writing things out was not the first level of storytelling I learned, but it was my storytelling and reading that selected me to go on to higher education. I really wasn't gonna go, but I was actually kind of corralled into going.\",\n",
              " 'That passion is what I try to bring to my students and people I mentor, trying to get them to understand that once you understand story structure, literacy, reading, and researching is the next natural place you go.',\n",
              " \"I've been with New Tech Now for about, I'd say, 2 and a half years. I was brought in as a consultant to research and design some programs that would fit into their technology pieces, which I did. And I've been trying to use those. It's a really nice combination for me because I can see, and we can soften, and see—believe in the classroom. When the students start to be moved from one area of learning to another, they can move from the technologies which can be very distracting at times, and then the storytelling can kind of ground them. We go back and forth. So it's been a very positive experience for me.\",\n",
              " \"Okay, yeah, that's a great question. Cause so we're considered an enrichment program. And we're completely mobile. So we do not have a brick-and-mortar location. We only serve other organizations. We go to after-school programs, we go into classrooms and work with teachers during school time, we go to community centers and gather students and families, and everyone works together. We also work with churches and homeschool groups at libraries..\",\n",
              " \"No, we were new getting into this space. I assumed that people would be happy to have you come into their organization and bring all kinds of learning elements. But we found that that's not always the case. Some of these programs are pretty active; they have a busy schedule. It was very difficult to actually get into school classrooms. We thought we would have the most impact there.\",\n",
              " 'But, as you know, classrooms are very structured. They have testing, they have their schedules. So it was very difficult for us to get into classrooms, and so we shifted to after-school programs. A lot of the larger programs that are in the city of Gainesville are pretty busy. They have lots of resources. But we found that going outside into the rural areas like Waldo, Archer, Hawthorne, High Springs, and Alachua, they have fewer resources. It was actually an easier fit because they had more time available. They needed the resources probably more and were just more open to working around a schedule that fit all of us, whereas it was a little more structured with some of the bigger organizations.',\n",
              " \"I mean, I feel like we have been successful with the combination. Like Dan said, we have the technology, which is what young people want and what they can relate to, but then we also have this hands-on component where we actually give them little notebooks, and there's nothing on the notebook. It's a cover and blank pages. It doesn't even have lines. So we give them these notebooks, and we say these are for you. If you want to draw a story, if you want to write a story, if you want to illustrate a story, this is for you to express how you communicate.\",\n",
              " \"That has been a good indication, so that we can kind of meet them where they are. They don't have to feel uncomfortable about how their friend next to them is doing it one way, and they need to do it in another specific way. We've found that most organizations that we visit do not have technology; they can't afford it. That's why New Tech Now was created. We wanted to give organizations the ability to have access to this equipment, give kids access. We've had many organizations tell us they want us to bring the equipment and teach kids just basic things like how to log into a program and use a password.\",\n",
              " \"To us, it seemed very basic like they should already know this. But, most of the time that we spend is getting everyone logged into a device so that we can get started with our program. We've built workarounds for that. I think being able to allow them to use this equipment to learn how to create, rather than just be consumers, has been effective. Giving them that hands-on element as well enhances the experience, because they need both skills. I think, for me and Dan, we're of a different generation, but we're seeing that kids still need that hands-on element.\",\n",
              " \"To engage them in what we're doing, we provide that technology piece, which gets them more excited and ready to participate. That's just my take on it.\",\n",
              " 'No. And and we I we always ask how many of you have computers at home, and they\\'ll almost all raise their hands. Then we\\'ll say, \"What are we talking about?\" and it almost always comes back down to a smartphone.',\n",
              " \"It's a lot different when you're actually in the trenches doing the work. For example, one of the things that I started with was saying to them, what do you read at home? Do? Do you read? What are you looking at? What do you read, what are you interested in? And if they would access that information and bring it forward, then when I tried to get them to create in the book, make up something. It would almost always just be that they thought they were trying to please me by repeating what they had said they were reading or learning.\",\n",
              " \"So I don't do that now until we're in the middle of the creative process. Then I say, what are you learning at home? What are you reading at home? And it's very bleak. But again, that was my background, too. The parents in that environment are often very focused on survival and getting food on the table, and they're not going to bring the World Book Encyclopedia into their home, you know.\",\n",
              " \"But anyway, the point is that there's been a lot of adjusting in the program. Janalyn does a thing on presenting using Canva. How do you present your idea? And I do the thing like, well, what's the idea? These skills that we're teaching, including if the students are ready for it, we'll do a presentation where we have a microphone and a little speaker thing, and they present.\",\n",
              " \"These are all skills they're going to absolutely need as they go up in school, and it's very barren where they're learning those skills where they are now. It looks like almost everything is just about discipline and not a lot of creativity, except for an occasional teacher that we run into, which is mind-blowing when we see it.\",\n",
              " \"To summarize, it's a lot of adjusting on the fly to the students that we're working with, having 4 or 5 units of literacy integrated into Janalyn's sessions. They're so excited to see what she offers, and I'm in the background waiting for that chance when I see that they've settled down. We can then try something within the books.\",\n",
              " \"So that's a great question, too. So originally, when we began writing grants, my experience was when I was bringing in the technology, it took—well, you needed at least 4 hours to work with them and for them to kind of get whatever it was we were working on.\",\n",
              " \"So that was my vision. But that is not how the system works. We take what we get. I'll just give you some examples. We work with Caring and Sharing Learning Center on the east side of town. We have a teacher there, and she loves for us to come in. If we had enough funding and everything worked out, she would probably have us come once or twice a week to do activities because she knows we have the equipment. She doesn't know all of the software that I know, but she does know how to teach. She's a wonderful, creative teacher, and we love working with her.\",\n",
              " \"In the past, we've gone 4 or 5 weeks in a row a couple of times a week, and then we took a long break, and then we might have come back a couple of times 6 months later. So it was the same children, but I've gone to her classroom for multiple years. She teaches second grade, so they're not the same kids, but we have kind of a good working relationship. Some of those kids I then see in the after-school program a couple of years later. So I've worked with those children throughout their life.\",\n",
              " \"We have other organizations where we might work with them for 2 hours, and that's all we will ever see of those children. For example, I went out to Melrose and worked at a church. Some of the kids that came to the church might live in a different county, so I may never see that child again. We also work with Girls Place. Girls Place is similar to Caring and Sharing. I've been going to see them for years. We started out with the second grade and did a program for about 4 hours generally. It's a little bit of an exception if we go over the 4 hours, but there are other activities for them to do.\",\n",
              " 'Those second graders, I came back a couple of years later, and they sent me to the fourth grade. It was the same kids. They said, \"I remember you. I still have my little thing we made.\" You do notice that you get a lot more buy-in from the kids when they have seen us multiple times. There\\'s a trust built. At A. Quinn Jones school, which is an alternative school, the kids had serious trust issues initially, but the more we were there, the more comfortable they got with us',\n",
              " \"So like I said when we first began, I felt like 4 hours of technology—I’m talking about the technology piece here. Now, we're not promising that in 4 hours you're going to be reading above the third-grade level. We want to engage you in literacy, make you feel more comfortable with reading, expressing yourself in storytelling, or understanding story form.\",\n",
              " \"For our program in 4 hours, say our goal is to teach you how to do 3D printing. Underlying that, my goal is that you understand 3D design. Now, you're probably not going to sit down and want to do something on a computer and learn 3D design unless you have some tangible outcome. I feel that any sort of design is important and a valuable skill. In 4 hours, I can teach you how to 3D print something, and I can prove that we can accomplish that goal. We've also introduced graphic design. At the end of a 2, 3, 4-hour block, I want to make sure that you have been able to accomplish the assignment we give. We pretty much meet those goals.\",\n",
              " \"Not for our goals, not for our nonprofit's goals. Now, Dan, you might want to introduce.\",\n",
              " \"Well, one of the things that I have underneath everything I'm doing is to recognize story structure. This comes from stuff that I've worked with from all ages. I worked at Paramount Pictures for 11 years in story rooms. I'm trying to get a group of a subgroup of the students to work almost like a story team. Asking questions like, okay, so what should happen next? What's the conflict? Where's your lead character? What happens in the middle of the story? And then what happens at the end?\",\n",
              " \"From this comes a very important literary skill, which is how to tell when someone is telling you a story and not necessarily telling you the truth. That is really so important right now. We try to touch on that subject and introduce it into the conversation, especially with our older students. Some get it right away—they recognize when it's a story and understand the questions to ask if they are really looking for information.\",\n",
              " \"Yes, because in other programs that take middle school to high school to college students and mentor them through their writing skills and nonfiction skills, that's exactly what happens. You can't do one without the other. You can't put a fictional character and make that character work without understanding that someone's going to ask, why are they doing that? What are they basing their decisions on? How are they seeing the world? Those are all nonfiction skills, those are essay skills. The storytelling aspect is profoundly important and almost invisible in our lives. We do it all the time, but we don't always recognize it.\",\n",
              " \"Well, as Janalyn has described, we are enrichment. So we're in there really in the trenches, reacting to the nature of the group of students that we're working with. We try very hard to look at the books and work with the books. Sometimes we even do a program where we keep the books and then return them to the students, so we’re actually looking at their work—not grading it, but looking at it. This gives us an idea of who has special needs and how we can address those.\",\n",
              " 'Janalyn and I work closely together on this and will quickly identify which students need special attention. We have to adapt for these students. There’s a lot of adaptation.',\n",
              " \"Right now, it's just the two of us.\",\n",
              " \"There have been times when we've been lucky enough to have some really talented people with us. One of them moved away for another opportunity.\",\n",
              " \"It’s very adaptive. We have these units that we know deliver and that we know result in the students having something in their hands, whether they've written a story in a book, drawn a story, or used stickers to tell a story. If they're more advanced, they might tell the story. We give them little prizes for telling the story. Janalyn does a lot of work on graphic design. Did they design their little poster? Did they take it home and show it to their parents? We’re also trying to involve the audience, parents, and other students in the presentation and performance. So it’s a big question, but I hope that answers it.\",\n",
              " \"The tool I'm using is based on 4 or 5 different university studies on story circle structure. I actually have a PDF I could show you if you want. It's real easy that we would use to show volunteers or whomever. Universities like the University of California have studies that show how storytelling and background information, which Janalyn is providing, lead to increased literacy. So we're using known and proven effective methods.\",\n",
              " \"We do not have a formal curriculum; we have units that we work from that we’ve designed because we know they’re very adaptable. If we had purchased a curriculum, it wouldn’t work for what we’re doing. We don't have the students long enough. We’re more of a performative presentation involving an adaptive teaching unit, so we wouldn’t be able to use a long-term curriculum.\",\n",
              " 'Yes, for the technology component, yes, we completely evaluate that because that is part of how our grants are written—that we will evaluate if the student learned how to design in 3D or learned how to code at a basic level. So yes, we do evaluate that. As far as the literacy component, like I said in the beginning, that was something we were bringing in as a bonus to our technology program. We are not considered a literacy program; we’re considered a technology program.',\n",
              " \"So, like Dan says, we’re kind of evaluating off of our personal backgrounds, what we've seen when we're in classrooms, what we know teachers are using as evaluation tools. Before we began this program, I was part of the United Way's Grade Level Campaign and other literacy initiatives. I actually asked, considering the community's literacy expertise, what tools we could use to start evaluating this component. But I got no answers, no responses that provided any concrete evaluation tools.\",\n",
              " \"So that's why we’re using our best judgment and what we know works in other areas. We are a technology program, and as far as evaluating, we are doing what we can.\",\n",
              " \"So let me explain why I haven't reached for some other simplified multiple-choice assessment tool. In one class, we may have students who vary widely in age and abilities, including those with special needs.\",\n",
              " \"I wouldn't be able to measure that progress in an hour and a half, 2-hour program that we do twice in 2 months. What we can do is show them how they can continue what they’re learning, where they are in their learning, and encourage them to pay attention. If a student says they’re really into Spider-Man, I ask them to explain the story structure of Spider-Man. We use that interest to give them something to take back.\",\n",
              " 'So, in many ways, we are an introductory program, enhancing student interest, developing student interest, and working towards some personal goal that the student may have.',\n",
              " \"I mean, I don't know that it's necessary for our program. I think, for our community, it would be helpful, as far as you as a researcher, if we’re asking several questions before we leave. Adding in one or two more, I’m not sure. Is it a question we ask, or is it something we observe and report back? Do we say, “Oh, by the way, we were in a classroom of 3rd graders, and we observed that probably 3 of them really needed some serious help”? But then, what do we do with that information?\",\n",
              " \"If there was some sort of tool that everyone in our community doing literacy programs could use, that would be wonderful. But I don’t know if that's even possible.\",\n",
              " \"Well, you know, as I mentioned before, my education degree is a research degree, and the number one rule about research is, you need to have stability. You need to have a control and some idea of what you're measuring against. That would be a place for schools that have regular students to create that environment and experiment with teaching to a test or not teaching to the test. In the kind of trenches we’re in, so much depends on flexibility, adaptability, and trusting that our tools and the results we get are showing progress from when we begin working with the students to where we end.\",\n",
              " 'Whether that progress can actually be considered research-based, I would have some doubts about achieving that with the way we’re working with students as an enrichment program at this time. That would be my casual observation.',\n",
              " 'Yes.',\n",
              " 'Yes, most everything that we base it on is something tangible we can look at and see that they created it.',\n",
              " \"For example, in one of our after-school programs, in one of the city centers, there was an art show after the program was done. The parents came, there was a pizza party, and the students' work was on the wall. That’s the kind of feedback and results we’re looking for.\",\n",
              " \"No, not that I'm aware of\",\n",

They know how to unlock a phone and play games on a phone, and they know how to change the settings of a phone. But when it comes to actual knowledge of technology, they really do not have that. I’ve noticed it with second or third graders all the way up to middle and high scholars.',\n",
              " 'It’s a huge misconception that we are constantly battling. People automatically assume, well, we don’t want to give kids more technology because they already have too much. But when I sit with a fifth or sixth grader and they don’t know how to open a computer, log in, and use software, that’s a major issue.',\n",
              " 'My biggest moment of realization came when I had a little boy who couldn’t read. I was reading to him, and he asked if he could play a game on the computer if he finished his books. When he went to the computer, he couldn’t log in because he couldn’t read or type. He used the voice recognition feature to proceed. That was a huge red flag for me.',\n",
              " 'He couldn’t type or read the prompts on the computer. He needed my help to log in. Then, when he needed to find what he wanted, he used the voice command to navigate. This underlined the severity of the issue—kids have limited actual technology skills beyond basic phone usage, and that severely impacts their literacy and overall educational experience.',\n",
              " 'If more teachers would teach storytelling and knew how to teach storytelling, both orally and in writing, and knew how to explore the story using science, more kids would have critical thinking skills. They would not be swayed by somebody standing in front of them, telling them a story that is not to their benefit. And that is my personal stance and what I really, really care about.',\n",
              " \"They need to passionately understand that the same things they care about, students are not able to care about yet because they don't understand what they're looking at or what they're hearing. They don't know they're being manipulated.\",\n",
              " \"So if we can, you know, if the organization is open to it, we love having those types of events where the whole family is involved. We want the kids to be able to showcase what they've done.\",\n",
              " 'Other ways we\\'ve done it include creating information for them to take home so they can continue the activity. I\\'ve geared it toward hoping that the parent might see this or the child might ask the parent for help. For example, they might say, \"I need to get on the computer to do this program I learned at school,\" and the parents will help them. We\\'re trying to get that information home and start a dialogue between the child and the parents. The books are another way to involve parents, hoping they will share the stories or activities at home.',\n",
              " 'I\\'d like to add to that. When I go through the books with each student, I ask them if they want to show this to their parent or someone they like.

The relationships we've built and have had for years are with organizations that know they can trust us. They know the kids are going to learn something valuable; we’re not wasting their time or the organization's time. The kids' feedback is our biggest goal—we really want to make sure they have a good time because they’re our main customers. If they’re not having a positive experience, they will tell someone, and someone is going to tell us we don't need to come back. Luckily, we haven't had that happen. We just want to make sure the kids have a positive experience when we're with them, and that everyone involved in the process has a positive experience.\",\n",

              " 'I have something. This is a little personal thing that actually comes from my working with high school students and college students. What I would like to see—this is a bit of a fantasy, but I think it would be tremendous—is that as soon as students started to show talent in literacy in the middle schools and high schools, there would be a citywide program that encouraged them to teach others and bring that forward, and we would reward them.',\n",
              " 'Some of the students I worked with under Janalyn would be filling out 2-3 pages in their story, and when I asked them to share, they would cover it because they didn’t want other kids to see that they could write so much when others couldn’t even read.

As far as getting educational resources if we need them, what I would love to see is more of a collaboration between the school board and the community center. Our goal is for their students to do well, so the students here do well, and the students that do well here in return go back and do well in the school system.

We have hundreds, if not thousands, of young people in our community who are reading far below grade level or can\\'t read at all. This is not just a school-based issue; it\\'s a community crisis and a family crisis. If a young person is struggling, they might eventually give up. This can lead to them quitting school, getting involved in gun violence, gangs, or the criminal system. If we look at their academic history, we\\'ll find indicators of these outcomes. Shame on us for passing students along knowing they can\\'t read. We need to take concrete steps to address this. We need to stand up as a community and as a county and say, \"We have to fix this.\" We cannot solely depend on the school board; we need to equip communities, especially rural ones, to help students in their areas like we are.

The worst thing to do is develop a program for someone without consulting them, only to find out that it\\'s not what they need.

            "We actually have a checklist for new programmers, and when they are being observed, more experienced staff will go through and check off when they notice the use of one of those five elements\n",
            "We follow those guidelines, and that really encompasses just about everything\n",
            "As learners get older, we focus more on creative programming, steam programming, and using technology\n",
            "For example, we have a recording studio here and try to get them involved in doing technology-based projects\n",
            "But that's assuming that the foundation has already been laid with a lot of these students\n",
            "If it hasn't, and we can recognize that it hasn't, then we try to find the resources outside of the library that are available to students through the school district or through the resource center, such as after-school help\n",
            "I mean, I think it's twofold\n",
            "The thing that would improve my role and my staff's role here at this location—it's very specific to our location—would be more staffing\n",
            "We're understaffed\n",
            "And more resources\n",
            "We are under-resourced\n",
            "This whole community, like many under-resourced areas in this community, really besides the library, the closest other location that's free and available for children and teens after school is the Martin Luther King Center, which is several blocks away\n",
            "It's a good walk\n",
            "There's a blight of other locations that can provide services and resources to children and older people after school\n",
            "We focus more on children because that's who we get the most\n",
            "Not that we don't get adults—our first half of the day is just all adults\n",
            "I don't know if you've ever been here, but it's a very small building\n",
            "But again, we get anywhere from 75 to sometimes over 100 kids crammed into the building\n",
            "There's 6 staff, and so we do our best to provide the resources and services and provide programming, but we're understaffed and we're under-resourced， not us as much like we have a healthy budget\n",
            "We can purchase things to do, crap to do our programs\n",
            "But the community as a whole is under-resourced\n",
            "Like I said, there aren't a lot of places for kids to get mentorship or have other outlets for after school to help with their learning\n",
            "So I love that\n",
            "I love Gainesville Drives\n",
            "We have someone who comes here weekly to provide information to people about registering to receive books, and I know Sarah from New World has been here tabling before\n",
            "So I think just information\n",
            "I think people aren't even aware—more marketing, more in-community information\n",
            "People aren't even aware that these services are provided and that they're free\n",
            "I also think it has to do with the fact that there aren't a lot of places to disseminate that information over here\n",
            "I don't know how much non-school information is provided through the schools\n",
            "I think having a presence in the schools on the East Side in particular, but in the schools in general, of all the different agencies that can assist the families\n",
            "I feel like all that stuff just needs to be more robust, like more tabling events, more community events where all of the resources are at least available for the families to know that they exist\n",
            "I think that would be really helpful\n",
            "Only that, you know, sometimes I feel like I went to a tabling event at Howard Bishop on Saturday, and it wasn't very well attended\n",
            "Granted, it felt like it was 200 degrees outside, and it wasn't a very pleasant afternoon to be outside\n",
            "But those are the kinds of things that I feel like if leadership can get behind and make it more of a special event, promote it more, have it be something more exciting\n",
            "Howard Bishop put this on, but I don't see why there's any reason why it can't become more of a thing—more grandiose\n",
            "Maybe even incentivize participation\n",
            "I've been to programs and special events that have felt like a big deal, but a lot of them have had some sort of other incentive for people to participate\n",
            "A raffle, free food, a magician, a DJ, performers—things like that—and they were more publicly marketed\n",
            "I think Gainesville and Alachua County have so much to offer when it comes to bridging the gaps and addressing deficits in literacy\n",
            "It's not that the resources aren't there; it's that people don't always know about them, and they're not easily provided or accessible\n",
            "My name is Helena McNeer\n",
            "I'm the Senior Library Manager of the Youth Services Department at the Headquarters Library, part of the Alachua County Library District\n",
            "So I do run the Youth Services Department, but I also lead district-wide initiatives like our summer reading program\n",
            "I work closely with our Friends of the Library to present our Snuggle Up and Read program, which involves story times at all of the local Head Starts and ensures that each student has a book of their own to take home\n",
            "I also help coordinate efforts like our Teen Art Show and our Teen Writing Contest and ensure that all youth staff throughout the district are trained and have the same basic understanding of what we are doing in our youth programs here\n",
            "I have been in this position since November of 2023, so I am still fairly new to this position and I'm still learning a lot\n",
            "But I have been with the library district for 11 years, and all of that time, other than my couple of years of branch manager experience, I was a youth programmer\n",
            "I worked with elementary-age and teenage patrons at our Code Park branch on the east side of Gainesville and did literacy programming with them\n",
            "And then I also worked at our Partnership branch with youth\n",
            "I really think that giving our learners a space to be creative, particularly for elementary age students and teens, to just be creative and try new things in a low-risk environment is vital\n",
            "We're not giving them a grade; we're not evaluating\n",
            "We're just giving them a place to explore different types of literacy and different ways to engage with literacy\n",
            "I think that has really been helpful\n",
            "When we are talking about our pre-literacy programming, as I mentioned before, we train all our library staff using the \"Every Child Ready to Read\" curriculum\n",
            "We demonstrate to parents during our story times, baby times, and music and movement sessions how they can integrate those pre-literacy skills into everyday activities with their children\n",
            "I think that has really helped our community become more confident in working with their children and preparing them for school and for reading\n",
            "We offer training and workshops\n",
            "Part of the training involves learning from each other and demonstrating to each other the things we should be seeing in our youth programs\n",
            "For all of our programs, we have a program evaluation form that we have our programmers fill out and then sit with their managers to review\n",
            "This ensures that they are incorporating all of the elements we want to see in programs and that the program meets our level of expectation for what we're trying to provide for our community\n",
            "We also allow all of our staff to attend professional development workshops and trainings through a variety of organizations, including NEFLIN, which is the Northeast Florida Library Information Network, and our professional organizations like ALA (American Library Association)\n",
            "We really encourage our staff to be creative, but we make sure they have the tools and knowledge necessary to work with our patrons\n",
            "I'm not sure, but I know that a lot of staff have been struggling since the pandemic with not having that personal training and the ability to network, work off of each other, and have those brainstorming sessions that we used to have\n",
            "I would like to see us come back and do more workshop-type environments where we're together and learning from each other\n",
            "I've seen that be very successful\n",
            "So, lots of money and funding to get more staff to be able to go and be in all of the places\n",
            "One of the big things that we have tried to do here is not just focus our library programming on the library\n",
            "We've tried to make sure that we are getting out into the community so that people can learn and know that we're here and see the things that we have to offer\n",
            "But that takes money and staff\n",
            "So, of course, it always comes down to that, doesn't it\n",
            "But having more availability to go out and be a part of the community where they are and let them know about the things that are available to them is crucial\n",
            "Some resources we can bring to them, and some they would need to come to us for\n",
            "But it's really about educating them to let them know what's here\n",
            "We try and start with conversations and ideas\n",
            "We invite our staff to have ownership in everything that we do and to bring their ideas to us so that we can work on ways to implement them\n",
            "Once we have a good idea, we start training and workshopping, doing that peer-to-peer mentorship, and allowing staff the opportunity to feel like they're supported in the things that they're doing\n",
            "Then we invite them to play\n",
            "We always say, \"play is the work of children,\" but we all learn from it\n",
            "So we allow them to participate and be a part of the things that we're doing\n",
            "Here in Youth Services, everything we do is for families\n",
            "When we do our story times, we make sure to engage the parents as well as the children, and we encourage them to participate in the programs we're doing\n",
            "We have a program here right now called \"1,000 Books Before Kindergarten,\" and we encourage parents through story time and other marketing throughout our branches to read with their children and participate, helping them prepare for school\n",
            "During the summer, we do our summer reading program, which is an all-ages program\n",
            "This year we're really focused on making intergenerational connections\n",
            "For example, with our discovery tracks, we invite participants to go out and try new things and discover new things\n",
            "This year, we designed it so activities could be done as a family, and everyone earns the same reward for doing those activities\n",
            "We always try to create opportunities for our community to come together\n",
            "One way we do that is through our Head Start program, Snuggle Up and Read\n",
            "We visit all of the Head Start classes generally in the February-March timeframe, where we present a story time and the Friends of the Library provide a book for each of the students to take home\n",
            "It's always one of my favorite programs because the youth are so excited to have a book of their own to keep\n",
            "When we're not doing that, we also make sure that we are out in those communities supporting those institutions, not just Head Starts\n",
            "We do outreach at Gainesville and all our branches go out into their local community to do story times at local childcare centers\n",
            "At Cone Park, they take their monthly calendar over to the Eastside Community Center and invite the youth that participate in the city childcare program to come over and participate in all of the library programs\n",
            "We try to go out into the community, be where they are, and bring the library to them\n",
            "We try to create partnerships where we can\n",
            "We have a partnership with Partnership for Strong Families at one of our library locations—I believe you've already spoken with them\n",
            "We also work with the Alachua County Children's Trust, and we have interns from the Youthworks program\n",
            "We work closely with United Way and their reading initiatives; we are part of their Campaign for Grade-Level Reading meetings and participate in that\n",
            "We participate in the Child Abuse Task Force and make sure that we are present and supporting their activities\n",
            "We try to support other organizations in the community, and they support us as well\n",
            "that's hard because reading has so much competition with other things\n",
            "But I think we need to encourage people to explore literacy in ways that are fulfilling to them\n",
            "For example, my son does not like reading; he hates it\n",
            "It was always a struggle to get him to sit down and read, but when we discovered audiobooks, he loved that because he could do what he wanted while listening or follow along in his book\n",
            "So we transitioned to using audiobooks even for his school reading\n",
            "I get the audiobook for him, and he follows along in his book\n",
            "So I think it's about finding the ways and expressing that it's okay, no matter how you choose to read\n",
            "It's valid\n",
            "We’re all already doing so much\n",
            "It's hard to come up with something concrete\n",
            "I do feel that there are improvements that could be made\n",
            "A lot of my experience is working at the Cone Park branch in East Gainesville, and many of the youth who came in were not coming in for books\n",
            "They were coming in for our technology resources and other things\n",
            "So I think having that role model, that example, that although digital literacy is important, so is reading, and so are the other activities we offer\n",
            "If we could find a way to allow our youth to understand the importance of reading—it's something we talk about in schools, but how do you make reading cool\n",
            "we got excited about 3 years ago\n",
            "When we looked all over the planet and said, where is the most vulnerable citizen\n",
            "And we fell in love with the early learning space from pre-k to kindergarten to 1st grade and you know, we designed an experience based on our last company\n",
            "And so, you know, I spent over a decade in creating language development at the higher Ed level\n",
            "We had a company that we started locally called Shadow Health and so, you know, that was really designed to prepare nurses to have better bedside language skills so they could have better interviewing skills\n",
            "And so when we sold that company to a veteran healthcare conglomerate, we reposition the same technology that we license from Uf in 2010, and we licensed a version of that for the early learning space\n",
            "And so we were very familiar with the language space\n",
            "But we didn't really understand the particular needs at the preschool level, because it's a completely different language need\n",
            "So we literally sat in classrooms for over a year and saw what was happening from a user experience\n",
            "And then we started reading about the science of reading and all of the different literacy gaps like the knowledge gap and just understanding the different\n",
            "And then we had folks like Holly Lane that we were able to sit with and learn from her\n",
            "huge scope of knowledge domain expertise in this area\n",
            "And so from there we decided to\n",
            "Okay\n",
            "You know, there's this equation of word recognition, times, language, comprehension, equals reading, comprehension\n",
            "And we thought we fit really well in this language side\n",
            "So, what could that look like\n",
            "And what evolved from there was\n",
            "We made images\n",
            "pictures, various pictures\n",
            "and we asked the kids\n",
            "okay, what these images were based on\n",
            "Social study standards and so, we really took a dual content approach of trying to personify these standards of social studies so that they could facilitate a literary skill\n",
            "And so it really allowed us to introduce narrative into the activities\n",
            "And so, with an image\n",
            "And some technology and a whole bunch of professional development\n",
            "Around language oral language instruction\n",
            "That's what birth asked me\n",
            "You know\n",
            "Great question we started off with the early learning space, all of the star standards for vpk, but then we also went to see palms and did all the K and 1st grade level standards as well, and then we because we had customers that were in Texas and New York\n",
            "We ended up\n",
            "You know, as you know, there's really 2 degrees of separation across the standards across the States\n",
            "And so, we ended up just allowing those standards to evolve based on who was using it, where\n",
            "So there's various uses\n",
            "Some of our users position it in a morning hour, and they allow the kids to basically show and tell their questions around various topics\n",
            "It's also used in a setting like the Holly Lane's 30-minute reading block around verbal reasoning and vocabulary\n",
            "We designed a lot of our activities to follow that and facilitate background knowledge and vocabulary\n",
            "We even hired directors from Sesame Street to help produce and direct 25 videos that personify each of the 25 social studies standards or the 4 strands\n",
            "So we've allowed the process to really meet where the need was from a content perspective\n",
            "this gives you a nice annual\n",
            "This is our Pre\n",
            "K\n",
            "And so what you'll see here is theme\n",
            "We have year one and year two, and we go through 15 assignments in each year\n",
            "We have language and literacy standards, and social studies standards\n",
            "Then we take you through your background knowledge, gather info, and then make meaning vocab knowledge\n",
            "Each area that we're building from a skill perspective is first to gather information in week one and then make meaning in week two\n",
            "We go through question stem words, verbal reasoning, and then literary skills and then communicating through some writing activities\n",
            "We've tried to allow for these units to capture understanding citizenship as individuals, understanding people, places, and things around me in unit two, and then understanding citizenship through the environment\n",
            "so we've mirrored our units with three different neighborhoods\n",
            "Meville would be unit one\n",
            "Each of these objects or individuals represent a different story, and I'll take you through one\n",
            "Each of these would represent an assignment and they all have poems that introduce that particular area\n",
            "If I were to go into week one, it would allow you to see a little more at the assignment-specific level, because we're still at the unit level here\n",
            "Let's try a different window\n",
            "If I were just to fast forward to show you the actual activity, here's where kids could learn nine story elements\n",
            "If they didn't know anything about them, we would teach them by first pressing character\n",
            "Questions are about the people and animals in the story\n",
            "So this is one of 10 days of lesson activities\n",
            "Let me pause there to give you a chance to react as to our user interface, or how this relates to scope and sequence, or how this relates to the health education standards of Minoland\n",
            "There's quite a bit of things that we include\n",
            "A large aspect of it is what we built in the last year, which is one of our teacher tool kits\n",
            "It's a pretty large volume\n",
            "The larger goal was to make the environment a richer language environment\n",
            "Our teachers were saying they understand the bigger goal but don't necessarily know how to facilitate or activate that\n",
            "A large motivation for going in this direction and getting them things was so it wasn't just screen time, but things they could use to actually present to the kids\n",
            "A large part of our instruction was around how better to increase the richer aspect of the language environment beyond just our activities\n",
            "So last year we had a full district rollout\n",
            "The district approved us, and we were in 20 something schools across VPK and first grade\n",
            "We had a meeting with the superintendent on Monday as to how strategically he wanted to reuse us\n",
            "We're waiting to hear\n",
            "The data was super compelling in terms of the progress that the various schools, from an A school to a D school, and how their data was similar, which was super encouraging for us\n",
            "We're waiting to hear back from the district as to what their preferred integration plan was for 24-25\n",
            "The basis of our data comes down to a verbatim transcript that gets generated with every question and response\n",
            "So, every time a student would ask a question, our system through our virtual characters would have a verbal response\n",
            "To track those conversational turns, our system captures it verbatim\n",
            "That transcript is what we now tag our rubrics to\n",
            "We can see how many questions fall into what rubric items\n",
            "Over 3 years, we have 5 or 6 different ways to look at it, but we're still learning what is the best way to evaluate progress\n",
            "Great question\n",
            "So schools have used it somewhat differently\n",
            "Some schools have used it in whole class instruction\n",
            "Others have started there and then progressed into more of a small group depending on the particular cohort of that classroom and the particular needs\n",
            "They would largely try to keep the whole group instruction, but then have certain populations put into a smaller group so that instead of them being able to participate in, you know, 15 or 20 total questions across 15-20 kids, now a small group of 4 would have 5 questions each\n",
            "So again, that's a great question because the reality is, and I'm speaking primarily about Alachua, they are using benchmark\n",
            "A lot of our teachers have to use the benchmark to fill their ELA\n",
            "We are being used as a supplement for the benchmark ELA\n",
            "They are finding various time slots in addition to that 30 min\n",
            "It might be 1 or 2 days a week in that time slot, another 1 or 2 days as a morning hour activity, and 1 or 2 days as a social studies activity\n",
            "When you look at the Gallopade workbook, it is Alachua's core social studies for early learners and is relatively basic\n",
            "Teachers have said we fit well to support the application or practice of the skills they are learning from other areas\n",
            "Those applications don't really have a practice opportunity where conversation is the method of learning to apply vocabulary or background knowledge on these standards\n",
            "This year there's been more conversation around using it to apply to the resiliency health education standards\n",
            "Each Minoland citizen has a particular challenge to overcome to become a superhero, and that challenge typically falls within the health education, resiliency scope\n",
            "And so we borrow against the scope and sequence of the 3 units\n",
            "We've barred against those 3 units to introduce each of the neighborhoods that represent and make up Menoland\n",
            "They mirror that\n",
            "So Meeville would be learning about your citizenship through the first 5 assignments, and those would typically be\n",
            "If there's an overarching theme, it would be, you know, responsibility\n",

            "And so what we're typically hearing is, it's some of the content is not being used\n",

            "Oh, man, let me, I really need this\n",
            "And so that hasn't necessarily been the ask\n",
            "Because, like you, for the last 2 years, we've been conducting our larger needs assessment\n",
            "And we've kind of done that to build the product experience\n",
            "So, you know, I think we're very language centric\n",
            "Because that's our 9 to 5, right\n",
            "But even there, it's the conversation continues to be pretty consistent from a needs assessment\n",

            "I feel like we will prepare a generation to be a lot more productive citizens and responsible citizens\n",
            "And so, you know, a large part of what we've spent a lot of time in is this approach to background knowledge\n",
            "And it wasn't just from the literary research of, you know, like things like the rope\n",
            "Right\n",
            "We saw when we started doing some focus group testing in the classroom the kids responded so well to background knowledge activities that related to their real life\n",
            "I'll give you one example\n",
            "So in order to teach timelines, we ask kids two questions\n",
            "What do you do every morning before you get to school\n",
            "And what comes first\n",
            "And so every kid in the classroom was able to say, Oh, I brush my teeth\n",
            "Oh, I eat breakfast\n",
            "Oh, I take the bus, and then we simply said as a follow up\n",

            "And and before we started introducing the standard which is so abstract\n",
            "All of these kids were able to activate some prior knowledge of what they do every day to now make the standard their own\n",
            "And so, you know, we are super passionate about taking the abstract nature out of things with higher background knowledge\n",
            "and allowing the words to become concepts that they can grow into life skills\n",
            "And so like, the technology is really the tipping point for us, right\n",
            "It's really a model for teachers to be able to transcend the conversational turns across the entire curriculum\n",
            "And that's why, you know, when we were making the product, we picked social studies because we thought, Hmm, you know, for last 30 years nobody's thought about social studies\n",
            "So something's wrong with that piece\n",
            "But we knew it wasn't really about social studies\n",
            "Social studies is such a rich content area that it forces you to internalize and say, Well, why\n",
            "Why is people of authority, important like, or you know why, our needs and wants important, you know, and every kid can walk away with the theme of one of our activities or our assignments\n",
            "Because it has a concept, life skill that they're going to use outside the classroom\n",
            "And we get to introduce that in an academic way\n",
            "So like, that's the perfect marriage between life skills and academic talk\n",
            "So that gets us fired up, because that's kind of the home run for me of early learning\n",
            "t's something that I constantly challenge myself in asking\n",
            "I do believe that there has to be\n",
            "We have these kids for such a small portion of their day and the other components of what makes a community thrive is where we need to lock arms with\n",
            "And so there needs to be an intentionality about\n",
            "So let me give you anecdotal\n",
            "So the last company that I had right\n",
            "I never wanted the work environment to be in a silo\n",
            "And so what did we do\n",
            "We found ways of doing life together right\n",
            "And so whether it was, every other weekend somebody's responsible for making a some kind of new meal, and then we all would again go over that person's house\n",
            "or we would find ways of playing sports together as a company\n",
            "you know\n",
            "Whether it was team, you know, corporate softball\n",
            "Or, again, whatever it was, soccer\n",
            "And what is that\n",
            "What's the takeaway from that\n",
            "In this setting we have to come up with a interconnected community\n",
            "and if the community doesn't thrive\n",
            "the education system will never thrive\n",
            "So therein lies my heartbeat\n",
            "It's the community has to be the priority\n",
            "and how to lock arms\n",
            "It has to start with the parents\n",
            "And so the parents in my mind is that\n",
            "But we haven't figured out an incentive beyond them doing homework right\n",
            "And that's not it's it doesn't meet the threshold of engagement\n",
            "Right\n",
            "We have to stop thinking like, educate us and start thinking like humans again\n",
            "and the humanity will prevail, and it will lend itself to us\n",

            "Thinking more in terms of how do\n",
            "how does the community win\n",
            "That's when we'll start making the right decisions about how education improves\n",
            "So it takes different stakeholders and different approaches\n",
            "It has to start in the classroom\n",
            "but it can't stay there, and I think that's where our challenge is we keep\n",
            "We keep such a singular linear mindset in terms of what is the way forward\n",
            "And the only answer is community\n",
            "If the community doesn't prosper\n",
            "no school or kid prost was\n",
            "I think it's more evident here than other districts that I'm in\n",
            "and I think it has a large thing to do with\n",
            "We've got a lot of professor kids right\n",
            "And so there's a high academic gap of performance\n",
            "And now you're comparing that to kids that come from different social economic experiences\n",
            "And so the gaps more visible in Alachua than any other district I've ever seen or worked with\n",
            "And it's because you've got super highly educated and super undereducated populations\n",
            "And so it's just the chasm is magnified here\n",
            "You know what a microcosm of it is\n",
            "and this is probably the most politically incorrect thing I can say, but it is what it is\n",

            "My daughter was a part of it, and she recognized it and said, Dad, I don't want to stay here\n",

            "So you know\n",
            "We've got, and every school has a version of Lincoln right\n",
            "And so you see it fan out into every education system\n",
            "It's just more prominent there because kind of reaches a tipping point because it's a middle school\n",
            "Yeah, so I'm gonna take a reach\n",
            "Thought about something that I have not really communicated before\n",
            "But your conversation kind of sparked something in my mind\n",
            "So you know, being in the healthcare education field for quite a bit\n",
            "I came across a larger thought\n",
            "Leadership that was very similar to this conversation\n",
            "and that was around there was a performance gap that existed in healthcare and there was a school of thought that was birthed in Harvard Business School back in the seventies\n",
            "That introduced this concept of value-based healthcare\n",
            "And it was in response to how fragmented healthcare is and why it was so expensive\n",
            "And the premise was basically when we typically go into healthcare\n",
            "We see a primary provider\n",
            "and then 6 months later\n",
            "We may have to see a specialty physician for some other system, cardio or respiratory, and then another year later\n",
            "We have to see another specialty provider\n",
            "And so that's 3 times the cost to that one patient\n",
            "So what Harvard Business School came up with was\n",
            "what if we took those 3 providers\n",
            "and we made them meet with that patient on the front end of their patient visit and said, Hey, what would you say\n",
            "Based on the history of this patient's workup\n",
            "What would you suggest\n",
            "The need is right now from a diagnosis\n",
            "And what happened as a result was that the patient recovery time shortened because their outcomes accelerated And the patient didn't have to come out of pocket 3 times for 3 X-rays every time they went to a different specialty specialist\n",
            "And so I guess what I'm coming up with\n",
            "If you back this up now to what we're trying to achieve in the education space from a literacy standpoint to a large part\n",
            "What you're doing, even with this Lastinger, you know, children's trust needs assessment\n",
            "Right is mirroring a value-based approach because you're bringing the providers, if you will, that make up the network of our community and saying, hey\n",
            "You know\n",
            "what should we do\n",
            "Different\n",
            "How should we think about the problem of the student that needs to now reach their potential\n",
            "And I think what you could do to accelerate this research is tap into what the Cleveland clinic\n",
            "How the Cleveland clinic responded to value-based healthcare\n",
            "And what they've done in the last 20 years is is remarkable\n",
            "And I think anecdotally, you will learn much more around\n",
            "how a provider took this out of the box approach that's non-medical and applied it in a medical term\n",
            "and had significant, you know, patient outcomes that would have never been achieved under the current healthcare model\n",
            "And I think that's what education is ripe for right now we need non educators to come and give us\n",
            "You know, a point of view that because we're so myopic\n",
            "you know, all we're thinking of is demographics and performance and reading\n",
            "that we're not stepping back and saying, You know, like the 1st meeting that I attended for you guys\n",
            "What I noticed was\n",
            "There wasn't anyone in any of the surveys that talked anything around language\n",
            "It was always all simply around reading\n",
            "And I thought, Well, I wonder why these guys aren't having any conversations around language\n",
            "Comprehension\n",
            "And it seemed like the study was largely limited to a more linear our point of view of reading\n",

            "I didn't want to raise my hand and share too much, because I was still trying to figure out what this study was about, and the scope\n",
            "And what what's the you know when you guys said potential\n",
            "And the only last thing I would say is, you know, I wasn't sure if you guys were spending any thought process around the active view of reading literature\n",
            "You know, Nell Duke introduced this active view of reading, documentation and analysis that it's added a lot more of the social skills, all the executive function and other aspects that is so critical\n",
            "And that's why we went back to the drawing table over the last year I had the Providence to have email, Nell Duke\n",
            "And she actually responded\n",
            "And I was like\n",
            "you know, like she's like my hero, like I'm I am so nerded out by, you know Nell Duke and I had an hour to talk to her just about how she thinks about where we are and what policy should look like\n",
            "And in the short of it is\n",
            "I'm only saying that not to name drop it\n",
            "It was just it was more a matter of me trying to understand\n",
            "What role does the social skill play in this reading piece\n",

            "you know, word, recognition, and language that we're not even in conversation with\n",

            "That I can't be too geeked out with, and so I've  just kind of kept my mouth shut\n",

            "side\n",
            "And the only reason why I even bring that up was, you know, my limited 2, 3 years of trying to understand this\n",

            "The child has to answer questions, write certain responses, and verbally share feedback\n",
            "We also receive input from counselors and teachers from constant interactions\n",
            "Once a child is matched with their Big, we get even more information, giving us a holistic view of the child's development, a significant part of which is their educational standing\n",
            "This allows us to hone in on that area effectively\n",
            "'s all about gathering these pieces together\n",
            "We consider the expectations that the parent has for the child, because that information gives us a window into the household's perception\n",
            "Where the child wants to go and where they're currently focused are important because reading is essential to everyone, regardless of their goals\n",
            "Whether they want to go to college or have a trade, everyone needs to know how to read\n",
            "If a child is struggling with reading, it's the tipping point to everything else\n",
            "When we identify a deficit and pinpoint where it is, we can work with the mentor and the parent to help support addressing that issue\n",
            "It's very individualized\n",
            "The enrollment process is crucial because if we see a youth, whom we call Littles, has a deficit in reading, we can tailor our support accordingly\n",
            "Whether or not a child has a desire to read, we still work with them and approach it strategically\n",
            "For example, not every Big will sit with a child to read or go to the library\n",
            "If we have a teenager who is enthusiastic about a movie, we might use a book related to that movie as an incentive\n",
            "If a child is more reluctant, we have to be strategic in engaging them\n",
            "This understanding also helps us find the right Big for the Little, ensuring the mentor has the skills needed to address the child's specific needs\n",
            "One challenge is that people sometimes get frustrated because they want a Big like tomorrow, but the matching process takes time\n",
            "We need to thoroughly understand the needs of each child\n",
            "Not all of our Littles have a deficit in reading or academics; some of them excel in those areas, so their needs lie elsewhere\n",
            "We do enrollment from age 5 to age 13\n",
            "But that doesn't mean when a Little turns 13, they are exited out of our program\n",
            "That's not the way it works\n",
            "We just try not to enroll past age 13\n",
            "We continually communicate with our mentors to focus on the goals and how to achieve them, discussing what is working and what isn't\n",
            "If everything else, like mental health and behavior, is in a good place and we're smooth sailing, we can really focus on helping the Little make academic gains\n",
            "We ask questions like: How are you spending your time with your Little\n",
            "What do you find effective\n",
            "Where are you focusing on academics\n",
            "What subject area is the Little struggling in\n",
            "We look for common factors by talking to the parent and the Little, and then we search for ways to support that area\n",
            "It's an ongoing process\n",
            "Some of our Bigs do like to go to the library, and we support them in those endeavors\n",
            "I mean, there's so many programs out there\n",
            "We have one that our Littles are doing, which has a math component where they can earn money\n",
            "They can do all sorts of things, and they have a debit card up to a certain amount, focusing on real-life math\n",
            "I wish there was something similar that focused on literacy\n",
            "For example, maybe a program with current events articles that the Littles would read and do a write-up on\n",
            "It could then get graded, highlighted, and selected for a platform's newsletter or something\n",
            "And they could somehow earn something from it as well\n",
            "And with our children, you know, the needs are great\n",
            "So maybe earning a little bit more than a gold star—like a gift card or something\n",
            "The math platform we have through Life Hub has been really awesome\n",
            "Something similar for literacy would be great\n",
            "I know our Littles would really love it\n",
            "No, the state standards are available, but they're not very applicable to what we're doing\n",
            "Yeah, we're very fortunate\n",
            "We partner with Stephen Foster Elementary and Idlewild Elementary\n",
            "Those are the two schools that we are currently in\n",
            "We're exploring the idea of entering another elementary school, and we definitely would like to begin the conversation about entering a middle school\n",
            "There's one that we have targeted\n",
            "For the last four years, we've focused on establishing good relationships at the ones we moved into\n",
            "We have great relationships with the counselors; the counselors have been so helpful throughout the Alachua County elementary schools at various times to really identify students and send us referrals so we can help\n",
            "At the two schools we're in, we have site-based programs there\n",
            "The others are for community-based Littles\n",
            "We have two different programs, but yeah, I would say the counselors are lovely to work with\n",
            "It just really depends on the time of year\n",
            "I have noticed, and from being a previous educator, I know what it's like\n",
            "There are times in the year when the load is a little heavier on the counselors, and we won't receive as many referrals for Littles from them\n",
            "Then the load will lighten up, they'll be able to focus on that additional support, and then the load will get heavy again\n",
            "We have two different programs\n",
            "One program is site-based, where the mentors go to the school and only meet with their Little at the school\n",
            "We also have community-based, where the mentors pick the child up—more times than not at their house—and then go out and about into the community\n",
            "It's hard to separate my role now from my role as a reading teacher, so I think I would need to draw on that experience\n",
            "When I was teaching 6th, 7th, and 8th grade reading, I had advanced, on-level, and intensive classes\n",
            "It was never a problem in my advanced classes, because those children had more focused time from their parents, who themselves often had more educational opportunities\n",
            "In my intensive and on-level classes, many parents hadn't had the opportunity for an education and felt overwhelmed supporting their children, creating a cycle of educational deficits\n",
            "When you get an 8th grade student on a 3rd grade reading level, the gap is so large, and you only have so much time to address it because of the number of students in the classroom\n",
            "To answer your question about the classroom, smaller class sizes for children with educational gaps and more adults in the room to help specific groups with specific needs is essential\n",
            "You can't serve all students effectively with a blanket content approach\n",
            "Less students, more adults\n",
            "Outside the classroom, I believe what we do—entering into homes and making a difference there—is crucial\n",
            "Although our focus is one-to-one mentorship with Littles, the coaching and mentoring that happens with parents in our community-based program is extensive\n",
            "We support parents through their challenges, even if it starts with a call about something that happened at school or grades\n",
            "We help parents navigate their struggles and encourage them to maintain the mentoring relationship for the benefit of their child\n",
            "Through this process, we become a lifeline for the parent, supporting the overall household and definitely impacting the academic realm\n",
            "If I think about what you're trying to do and the accessibility for UF students to have learning opportunities while benefiting the youth in our community, I think there's a balance to be struck\n",
            "Some schools are over-flooded with UF students coming in to support, while others aren't getting any support at all\n",
            "Of course, transportation needs to be considered, but behavior issues in classrooms are increasingly causing problems, making it hard to make progress throughout the day\n",
            "If you can give one child one-to-one attention, build rapport first, and then move into academic gains, you're going to make a huge difference\n",
            "If you flood schools with UF students as a requirement of some sort, but don't just send them in aimlessly—focus on certain standards and content related to those standards, and have them move through at the pace that the child can handle—that would be helpful\n",
            "The associated costs would be low, although there is always some cost, but it would be relatively low\n",
            "I will just say that what I've already mentioned is what I would say to my students all the time, especially in my intensive classes\n",
            "I know that I would spend a lot of my salary on tools for my intensive classes\n",
            "To get them engaged, I would buy 30 copies of a book that I knew would intrigue their interest—something that would allow them to buy into what we were going to do\n",
            "I would always remind them that reading is the one subject that affects all the rest of their subjects\n",
            "If you can't read or don't enjoy it, you're going to struggle in other areas\n",
            "I would try to get them to truly love reading, to enjoy the growth that occurs in their minds, and to explore things and places they'd never been before\n",
            "I appreciate what you're doing, your initiative, and I'm excited to see where you take it\n",
            "I'm Carmen Hurtado\n",
            "I have been at the Cade Museum for 4 and a half years\n",
            "Now I'm the senior manager of education\n",
            "So my team works really closely at developing our educational content and lead teachers for museum programs\n",
            "I also handle a lot of our inventor programs as well\n",
            "So regarding our little sparks program, it's not just literary literacy specific\n",
            "We focus on steam in general, but a part of that program is these different stations that focus on fine motor, gross motor\n",
            "And we also have a story time rug area\n",
            "And that's where we like focus our literacy efforts\n",
            "Really, just trying to like promote a love for reading lots of board books that have you know, different ways to engage, whether that's by touching or have, you know, different colors, bright colors, and things for them to look at in that space\n",
            "We also try to kind of promote parent involvement and kind of encourage them to continue reading at home\n",
            "With the kids as well\n",
            "So within little sparks that's really kind of the tools that we use\n",
            "It's the books that we're reading, and also the way we train our team on how to engage with the children during that station during that space\n",
            "So our team\n",
            "Well, my team at the Cade for in museum programs, you know, just like Patty kind of leads the way through outreach\n",
            "You know my team leads the way for the implementation in the museum, and then we try to hand it off to our educator staff is our weekend staff that leads those programs\n",
            "So we have internal training\n",
            "And in those trainings we try to have them kind of like workshops\n",
            "Where we talk about scaling, you know\n",
            "this program is specifically 0 to 5\n",
            "But what if older sister, older brother comes\n",
            "So we talk through that\n",
            "We also try to mimic and and kind of showcase how we would, you know, read a story, or do some of these activities with the child at different age, you know 0 to 5\n",
            "There's a lot of different skills that are kind of achieved, you know within that time period\n",
            "So really comes down to our internal internal training and kind of learning from our guests and the children that we also see something about us, and I think Patty will find this true is we're constantly learning you know how to improve our implementation\n",
            "You know, making sure that we are achieving goals and efforts, you know, for the county and the kids that we see, but also just for our staff, and just constantly learning what our guests enjoy and what they find is helpful to use with those children in that program\n",
            "That's a good question\n",
            "I'm trying to think of anything specific, but specifically with our training for reading\n",
            "we try to train the team to get down on the children's level with the books\n",
            "You know, point out different specific vocabulary related to the topic\n",
            "You know, kind of get them to maybe foreshadow a little bit based on what the book is about\n",
            "and just try to kind of work on those early development of comprehensive skills\n",
            "But again, that kind of like alludes back to to training efforts\n",
            "I don't know if there are any sort of specific tools\n",
            "Aside from that, that, we've kind of put into our training\n",
            "aside from those\n",
            "But you know, funding is an important part\n",
            "That would help support more visits for what Patty is doing\n",
            "in her efforts in Ecs\n",
            "For us\n",
            "It would help with materials\n",
            "And you know, with our program in the museum it is a little tricky\n",
            "It's free to members and free with admission\n",
            "But we do have an admission fee\n",
            "but we continue to see that program grow, and we would love to also be able to take\n",
            "And you know in tangent with Patty what Patty is doing, but also take the in museum program out to the community, too\n",
            "so you know, funding and staffing efforts for programs like that, I think, would be a big help\n",
            "You know, I think we have a formula that we feel like is working\n",
            "And hopefully, it's making an impact\n",
            "Although we're constantly learning and making edits based on what we see\n",
            "But you know, to have larger impact\n",
            "We just have to get out there and trying to reach more groups of kids\n",
            "And you know we have in the past\n",
            "Once or twice, you know, tried to partner with Gainesville thrives with Dolly Imagination library, and trying to have them come to the museum to also, you know, catch those little spark parents to get them signed up for their book program\n",
            "Because we also, you know, if we could get out there in the community more, we can encourage more of the reading at home\n",
            "And literacy at home, too\n",
            "Yeah, so something about our outreach efforts in general, all of our outreach partners, everyone that is involved in in Ecs\n",
            "All of those children get free community memberships to the museum so they can come see Patty when on her visits\n",
            "But then they're also welcome to come to little sparks at the museum because they would come in for free cause\n",
            "They are a community member\n",
            "So that's one of the ways that we can encourage them back to us\n",
            "But like I mentioned, we have tried and have had Gainesville thrives\n",
            "Come to the Museum for sign ups for Dolly, Imagination library, their book program\n",
            "and just trying to continue with our interactions with the parents\n",
            "And just letting them know the resources that are available to them\n",
            "whether that's our community partnership, or Gainesville thrives where we have our resources\n",
            "You could try this method at home\n",
            "No, and I've heard but it start\n",
            "When does it start\n",
            "Kindergarten\n",
            "So we actually have a program right now with Alachua county public schools\n",
            "it's has evolved\n",
            "We've been working with 5 different schools for the past 3 years, and then the program has run for about 5\n",
            "Now\n",
            "So we do have that program\n",
            "Where we visit the schools\n",
            "Patty visits the schools with Kate in the classrooms as well as some of our other K teachers, and then they also we also facilitate in museum visits\n",
            "About once a month on a field trip day on an early release Wednesday\n",
            "So because of that partnership, we're able to have an agreement and kind of stay connected with the School Board, and such, because it does have to get approved at the superintendent level\n",
            "That's a good question\n",
            "Since we do have so many outreach efforts, we're always in connected in the community\n",
            "You know, we're part of community meetings, you know, specifically like with Gainesville Housing Authority, we have a partnership with them\n",
            "We're in their monthly kinda update meetings for that area\n",
            "So it's kind of just our relationships and maintaining our relationships with our staff\n",
            "Patty has a strong relationship with these groups that she goes out and sees and you know, my team is able to help kind of maintain some of those relationships through our partnerships and tabling efforts\n",
            "You know you'll find us at the library at their homeschool kickoff\n",
            "You'll find us at other outreach efforts\n",
            "We were just at the 4th of July event for the Children's Trust of Gainesville\n",
            "So that's how we kind of stay connected\n",
            "Doing our best to be everywhere\n",
            "You know it's for me that's tricky\n",
            "you know\n",
            "I mean, continue programming all around Gainesville\n",
            "I will say Gainesville does a good job at trying to have a lot of resources\n",
            "Including the resources that we provide\n",
            "But I also feel like there could be a really big impact on workshops for parents\n",
            "You know, I have a young daughter\n",
            "And I'm familiar with a lot of you know I was\n",
            "I'm in education, you know, all the time that was what I studied\n",
            "So I'm kind of aware of methods and things like that\n",
            "So I work my best to do my best to practice those efforts with my daughter\n",
            "But, you know that can't be expected of every parent\n",
            "So also having resources for them to kind of, you know\n",
            "Hey\n",
            "You know, reading to your kid every day, even if it's just a quick, short book that's helping them learn new words\n",
            "You don't realize it, but they're hearing those words and exposes them to more words\n",
            "So I think that could be a layer that could be helpful\n",
            "If if parents could have the time and the resources for workshops on kind of learning how to engage with their children and reading and writing\n",
            "Yeah, to tack on to Patty\n",
            "a music program would be great\n",
            "It's so expensive to have a child play an instrument\n",
            "Just for the instrument itself, and then the cost of classes I mean\n",
            "that would have impact, too, because it's there is a connection there with literacy and music\n",
            "I was thinking, is, we have all of these groups that are that are doing such amazing efforts\n",
            "Could you imagine the impact if we got all together\n",
            "And we're all on the same page and helping each other and promoting each other\n",
            "That could have impact\n",
            "So you totally read my mind on that\n",
            "My name is Patty Lipka\n",
            "I'm the director of Experiential education\n",
            "I was recruited from Wisconsin almost 13 years ago this fall\n",
            "I've been at the Cade when it was a mere pile of dirt, a dream\n",
            "Raising mission\n",
            "As I like to tell people I have over 30 years in science, education, and formal in the museum field\n",
            "This is hopefully, my swan song, my last to leave my fingerprints on something I work in primarily now outreach\n",
            "So I am the first one out the gate collaborating with new community partners, Kate, in the classroom offerings, and I go where we are needed\n",
            "So that's my shtick\n",
            "Well, the one that I'm working with currently is Episcopal children's services\n",
            "And start\n",
            "I work with a it's called Head start at stem\n",
            "Start, I developed, and it's for ages 3 to 4\n",
            "It opens up with music movement\n",
            "We do letters, numbers\n",
            "We weave it into the topic\n",
            "We're talking about counting or identifying letters, reading basic words\n",
            "And then we go into science, little exploration\n",
            "And then we make our project, and we never call it a project or our craft, we call it\n",
            "Let's make our invention\n",
            "So we use the word invention a lot\n",
            "We want the kids to embrace the idea that even the way you sit on your square on the rug can be an inventive method\n",
            "Some kids are so cute they'll stand up and they'll touch their toes twice, and then they sit down and they go\n",
            "This is my invention\n",
            "Oh, I'm going to sit today\n",
            "And I love seeing these kids try to be different out of the box, thinking just very simple things\n",
            "But it can lead to bigger things as they age into the school system\n",
            "And that's what we want to make sure they're doing\n",
            "We've been with head start Episcopal children's services for over 4 years now, and it's grown exponentially\n",
            "They wanted 1st story time with reading, and much like our little sparks\n",

            "I feel like one of our jobs is to know about all community resources so that we can make referrals to families who come to us in need\n",
            "It's not unusual for us to have families with a child who has not become a conventional reader and writer, and a parent who also is not a conventional reader and writer\n",

            "the Community Foundation has just over 140 of these different types of funds\n",
            "So we have had other funds fund literacy projects\n",
            "Okay, I can look back 3 years and send you an email of who we funded\n",
            "And you probably have had contact with most of them, I'm sure you know\n",
            "And on top of just funding, we've done a lot of capacity-building work with them\n",
            "Coming to our trainings\n",
            "And so, on top of funding, there's also our nonprofit training program\n",
            "Yes, engage in fundraising board governance structure, that type of thing\n",
            "Okay\n",
            "So I can try to pull the organizations and programs\n",
            "that for the last 3 years\n",
            "And do you consider 2024 a year, or how far back are you going\n",
            "Sure\n",
            "Sure\n",
            "I mean, I'm probably goanna wear my funder's hat in all of this, and I think that General, would be some type of collaborative effort\n",
            "I know there are many organizations working in this\n",
            "And there's many organizations that are hard to even identify, because when someone walks in, and they're helping them with support literacy somewhere in there, and not necessarily always at the forefront or at the front of their mind that they're working on literacy\n",
            "So you know, some type of collaborative effort where there are training provided to all those that are providing literacy, even though they don't necessarily see that literacy is the main focus of what or a focus of what they're providing\n",
            "I'm not sure that I have a good answer for that\n",
            "I mean, I think that it's a big problem that we're maybe unaware of the scope\n",
            "And so I think it kind of hits all areas and all demographics of our community\n",
            "Very good question\n",
            "I mean, there's goanna have to be some type of lead agency on it, whether it's an existing nonprofit or a coalition of these nonprofits working together\n",
            "you know, I think, that someone has to take the lead and ideally, it's an organization already working in the space that's primarily doing literacy\n",
            "I think the first step is a joint conversation around literacy\n",
            "I'm not sure that that has happened recently\n",
            "There are joint meetings going on around housing and food, insecurity and children's-based organizations\n",
            "I'm not sure that there has been any community roundtable or gathering about literacy in general\n",
            "Hi\n",
            "My name is Shareen Baptiste\n",
            "I'm president and co-founder of Dream On Purpose\n",
            "Which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering youth with a specific focus on young ladies between the ages of 11 to 18 to dream and to actualize their dreams\n",
            "Dream On Purpose has been operational ever since 2015\n",
            "So we've been running for nine years\n",
            "So we have had \"Cupcakes and Conversations\" dedicated to entrepreneurship\n",
            "We spoke to the young ladies about these tools\n",
            "And then we also have \"Career Launch Intensive\" where on the first day we have a workshop, and the young ladies are encouraged to write down a plan concerning their career pathway and their desired interests\n",
            "Specifically for that event, in order for them to participate as part of \"Career Launch Intensive,\" they have to write an essay\n",
            "The essay is usually at least 500 words minimum and is on the topic of why dreams are important\n",
            "So when they go shopping the next day they receive feedback on what they can do to better solidify their positioning for success within those fields\n",
            "We don't focus necessarily on their writing or literacy capabilities\n",
            "We don't read their essay to point out grammatical errors\n",
            "From a higher level\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "But with the events that we have mentorship usually comes in the form of that particular event\n",
            "So it's not an ongoing mentoring relationship\n",
            "So I don't think it gets to be as detailed as that\n",
            "Now, me personally outside from Dream On Purpose\n",
            "I do, mentor, you know, some young ladies, and you know we do have conversations regarding grades\n",
            "Where they would like to be\n",
            "What opportunities I can help connect them with\n",
            "But again, it's still not granular to where I look at their writing abilities and styles, and provide them feedback on how they can improve\n",
            "Not in particular, no, because we don't have a full-fledged mentoring program\n",
            "We provide them with guidance for the event itself, such as what they should expect, how they can engage the young ladies at their table if they're serving as a table discussion leader, the topics, and conversation prompts\n",
            "So we'll give them guidance specific to the event to help engage the young ladies in conversations\n",
            "But Dream On Purpose does not have an official full-blown mentoring program\n",
            "It all just relates back to the topic of the \"Cupcakes and Conversations\" that we're hosting at that time\n",
            "I'm drawing a blank off the top of my head, but I can go back and look at some of the events that we've done previously and what the discussion topics were centered around\n",
            "Would that be helpful to you\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "So give me one second\n",
            "I have all of our files here\n",
            "I just didn't really know what to expect, so just bear with me\n",
            "So I took it all the way back to 2016\n",
            "One of our very first \"Cupcakes and Conversations\n",
            "\" I searched my inbox and found where I gave instructions for one of our sessions called \"Breaking Glass Ceilings\n",
            "\" I provided the table discussion leader with a flyer of the event, the agenda, and a worksheet for a career aptitude test\n",
            "We introduced speakers, had Q&A, and the young ladies worked together to develop a group campaign that they later presented\n",
            "The leaders of the group presented their campaign speeches\n",
            "We went over the career aptitude test with the young ladies and discussed women in leadership, which women inspire them, and provided tips for young women who aspire to be leaders\n",
            "We also gave instructions for a group activity on launching a campaign for class president, including examples of a campaign speech\n",
            "That is just one example of one event\n",
            "Each \"Cupcakes and Conversations\" is tailored to the specific topic being addressed and the resources, as well as the people who are presenting\n",
            "Yeah, I found the interactive discussion guide for another \"Cupcakes and Conversations\" that we did\n",
            "We try not to repeat events; even if we do the same topic, we approach it in a different way\n",
            "For \"Cupcakes and Conversations,\" some of the key elements are the engagement of our young ladies\n",
            "Whether that's having small group discussions, presenting information in different ways (speaker, screen, handout), or getting each and every one of them to stand up and do something\n",
            "It's very much centered around their engagement, making sure they utilize their voice to ask questions and share their opinions\n",
            "Yeah, I definitely believe that there's a correlation between the two\n",
            "So there's some examples that I can give you for DOP Reach\n",
            "When we held this pilot program at Santa Fe High School, we specifically worked with the guidance counselor to select young ladies who were right in the middle\n",
            "They weren't necessarily failing or excelling, because those students often get catered to\n",
            "It’s the youth in the middle who sometimes get overlooked\n",
            "She selected those who could have been doing better academically, those having difficulties socially, and those constantly fighting and not seeing eye to eye with their peers\n",
            "When we went in, we did the Dove leadership curriculum focused on leadership and self-esteem building\n",
            "We talked to the ladies about beauty standards within society, asked them to journal their thoughts, and come back to discuss\n",
            "By the end of the six-week session, we got reports back from the guidance counselor that they were doing better academically and socially\n",
            "Some young ladies who were frequently fighting were doing that less and were more excited and focused on returning to the DOP Reach sessions\n",
            "While we don't typically track academic standings as a data point, after every session, participants complete a survey\n",
            "The survey tracks their prior knowledge about the topic, how confident they feel after the session, what they learned, what they will do differently, and topics they want us to address in the future\n",
            "If needed, I can go through our survey responses for more specific information on impacts like learning about financial aid or applying for college earlier\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "I would agree with that\n",
            "Not anything that comes to mind\n",
            "I wanted to make sure that our volunteers were wrapped and trained concerning mental health counseling\n",
            "So I worked with Meridian, and we hosted a training session\n",
            "Our people got certified in that\n",
            "I've previously worked with Gator CPR to ensure our people were First Aid, CPR, and AED trained\n",
            "I've also offered knowledge on epilepsy training\n",
            "Additionally, we did a sexual abuse prevention training\n",
            "I try to take advantage of training opportunities within the community when they're offered\n",
            "There's one on grant writing coming up that a team member and I are attending\n",
            "I can't think of anything else\n",
            "Maybe sometimes it would help to know what some of these young ladies are going through so we could better relate to them\n",
            "But there's nothing that really exists for that other than you know us making sure that we're plugged into social media, understanding, latest trends and being open-minded, and, you know, actually speaking to the youth to see what they're going through or what's up and what's down\n",
            "Capacity, Capacity from the manpower standpoint\n",
            "So everyone who you know supports Dream On Purpose, whether it's as a board member, team member, or intern\n",
            "No one is paid\n",
            "So it's all 100% volunteer-based which means that we all have full-time jobs and all of that\n",
            "So I know, like in my case\n",
            "If Dream On Purpose was my full-time job\n",
            "I would be able to take the organization further\n",
            "We would be able to do more things, we would be able to reach more students\n",
            "I wouldn't be as burnt out as I get like capacity from that standpoint\n",
            "But considering all of the obstacles that we have ahead of us and the challenges, I do think that each year we grow significantly, and I think we're doing well for a 100% volunteer-led organization, so I can't complain\n",
            "So specifically for Dream, for \"Cupcakes and Conversations,\" we invite professional women excelling in their careers to serve as table discussion leaders\n",
            "It's our way of offering a mentor for a day for a few hours throughout the event\n",
            "With DOP Reach, we partner with various individuals and subject matter experts to lead the process\n",
            "For the upcoming DOP Reach, we are working with a trained facilitator who is building a curriculum, and we are also partnering with a licensed mental health therapist\n",
            "Also with Cupcakes and Conversations\n",
            "We make sure that we were not the subject matter experts on the topics that are being presented\n",
            "So we work with those who are subject matter, experts in the in their fields\n",
            "For something like Crown Placement, where we take the young ladies to a local spa\n",
            "So that's also another partnership and community engagement opportunity\n",
            "They get a facial as well as a pedicure done, and then we invite different speakers to come out and talk to them about their health, whether that be physical, mental, or emotional\n",
            "So this July 13th to two weeks ago we presented a team of dentists to the young ladies who talked about oral hygiene, and then we had a physician assistant who talked about feminine health and that particular type of hygiene\n",
            "And then for Career Launch Intensive\n",
            "We work with various individuals to come out to lead the workshops, and then, when we take the young ladies shopping for interview ready clothes the next day\n",
            "We invite women who are leading in those fields\n",
            "That the young ladies identify that they want a career in\n",
            "We pair them up with a young lady, and they get to shop for about 2 hours or more, where they, you know the young lady can ask questions about the career from what to wear to whether they like their job and how they got to where they are\n",
            "And then with Filming With A Purpose, which was an 8-week after school program every day from Monday through Friday\n",
            "For an hour we specifically worked with the young people to teach them all about the film industry\n",
            "So we had various speakers come out and talk to them\n",
            "We also, you know, engaged in community partnerships with the locations that we used as well as a couple of studios here in town, who allowed the young people to come to their studios to produce a documentary\n",
            "So everything that we literally do involves community engagement and partnerships\n",
            "Otherwise we wouldn't be successful in delivering these programs and events to our young people\n",
            "So we are hoping to expand\n",
            "We recently applied for a grant from the Children's Trust, focusing on expanding great programming to other cities within Alachua County\n",
            "Our plan for DOP Reach is to host one session in Gainesville at Gainesville High School for 9 weeks, then host a session in the spring, hopefully returning to Santa Fe High School in Alachua\n",
            "We're hoping that the following fall semester, we can go to Hawthorne Middle and High School, and in the spring of the next year, to Newberry High School\n",
            "This would be the first time we physically expand our services to different communities\n",
            "Because of COVID-19, we started doing some things either hybrid or virtually, which allowed us to expand our reach beyond Alachua County\n",
            "We have many students from Marion County attending our events\n",
            "If we receive this grant, it will be the first time we can go into these other communities to bring our programming to them\n",
            "So I know there are some schools with reading programs where various professionals can go in and read to the kids\n",
            "I've not participated in a program like that, but I think it's beneficial\n",
            "Having more of those programs at schools would go a long way\n",
            "I think having some type of arts program that can bring to life the words in books would also be beneficial\n",
            "There's your traditional plays and stuff, but something like \"Filming With A Purpose\" is pretty cool because it reaches students who might like film but not necessarily enjoy reading and writing\n",
            "Those elements can come to life on camera\n",
            "So having more traditional as well as unconventional programs like that would be a plus\n",
            "I don't think that there's any one or like one person or one organization that's responsible\n",
            "I do think that it's a whole community effort and initiative\n",
            "So I do think that you know some of these organizations, nonprofit organizations that are already existing\n",
            "If it makes sense for them to like do something within their scope\n",
            "Then you know, I think, that they can carry the torch in that regard\n",
            "But I do think, too\n",
            "You know, there's some responsibility on our public school system\n",
            "There's also responsibility on parents and families as well\n",
            "It takes an entire village to support a child, and, you know, ensure their success in the world\n",
            "And so I think it's gonna require a combination of at least at minimum\n",
            "Those three circles coming together\n",
            "And then, obviously, if the business community can also get behind it and put money behind these types of efforts and initiatives as well as government programs and grants\n",
            "Then we could, you know, have a surefire way of, you know, ensuring that we put together enough support to help our young people succeed\n",
            "There's probably a couple of things that we can do\n",
            "Yes, we have libraries, but not everyone always has transportation to them\n",
            "Creating pop-up sites where our youth can access books, whether physical books or some type of electronic reading like Kindles, would be helpful\n",
            "Increasing access would be helpful\n",
            "Another thing we could do as a community is to incentivize reading\n",
            "All the groups I mentioned could work together to make reading fun again\n",
            "For example, when you read a book and write a synopsis, you could get gift cards to the movies, restaurants, etc\n",
            "Incentivizing reading and making it fun again\n",
            "Libraries are definitely thriving, and a lot of people still use them, especially the rooms and stuff they offer\n",
            "But I do think they could receive more support for their campaigns and work\n",
            "Having our community promote their programs is a low-hanging fruit\n",
            "We can all help better incentivize and increase literacy\n",
            "Partnering up with the library, promoting their programs, doing more read-alouds with the students, and increasing access to books and literature, whether electronically or physically\n",
            "As a community, incentivizing reading and making it fun again by coming up with challenges or providing gift cards for each book read, and writing a synopsis or a log that summarizes the books they read\n",
            "The thing about it is, all our kids read\n",
            "In order for them to engage on social media and communicate with friends involves literacy\n",
            "We can shift the perspective on reading—that it doesn't have to be long, boring textbooks\n",
            "Helping our kids understand that they can connect with their passion through reading is important\n",
            "If they care about sports, they can read the sports section of a magazine or a guide, or read up on their favorite celebrity\n",
            "Getting our young people to understand that all forms of reading are beneficial; it doesn't have to be just long, old books they feel they can't relate to\n",
            "I was already tired, and I literally have, like no 0 brain energy left\n",
            "But I'm surprised those things came out of my mouth\n",
            "So I think this is successful\n",
            "My name is Terrie Robinson\n",
            "I am the Director of Programs for the Early Learning Coalition of Alachua County\n",
            "I've been in this role for a year and a half\n",
            "Right\n",
            "Well, I think the curriculum is great, but without guidance, I think curriculum paired with the coaches to help with knowing how to implement the curriculum is the best that has worked\n",
            "Giving a curriculum without guidance means they may not know how to implement it with fidelity\n",
            "When you're being intentional and want to drive your data, pairing coaches with the curriculum is advantageous\n",
            "For example, with coaching on Creative Curriculum or any chosen curriculum like Frog Street, it has been beneficial to implement that coaching piece to guide teachers in understanding their numbers and data\n",
            "After PM period 1, when we test our students and look at the data, the coach reviews it and shows teachers how they can use the curriculum to drive positive outcomes\n",
            "So, the best thing is not just the curriculum but the curriculum paired with coaching, professional development, and guidance, especially when looking through the lens of class tools\n",
            "That's what really helps\n",
            "Well, each curriculum that's on the list, our coaches are trained for\n",
            "The provider has the option to choose a coach, and we give them that option\n",
            "The coach then meets with them, looks at their classroom, gives them best practices, models with them, and looks at their data—all around what's going on\n",
            "It's not just about behavior\n",
            "Most of the time when a classroom thinks they have behavior issues, it's actually not a behavior problem\n",
            "I observed a classroom yesterday where the teacher called me to check out a behavior issue, and I had to tell her, \"This has nothing to do with the students and everything to do with you\n",
            "\" There was no schedule, the students didn't know what to do, there were no transitions in place, and a lot of learning time was lost\n",
            "I was there for about two and a half hours, and not one book was read to the students\n",
            "When I told her at least 8 to 12 books should be read in a day, she was amazed\n",
            "So, when we're talking about coaching and curriculum, those who choose to coach—whether it's practice-based coaching, which we do here and really love—find it beneficial\n",
            "Our coaches are trained to go out with all the curriculums, to help teachers make lesson plans that are going to drive their numbers\n",
            "I wish they could address and adapt more on classroom management\n",
            "That's the key\n",
            "Even when I was a preschool teacher, once your classroom is managed—meaning you have an engaged class—you are able to teach\n",
            "But without that classroom management, without knowing how to engage students, it becomes challenging\n",
            "I don't think they should call it classroom management anymore; I say they should call it classroom engagement\n",
            "When students are busy with jobs, they don't have time for behavior issues\n",
            "I told a teacher yesterday, \"They have no jobs\n",
            "You need a teacher's helper, someone to hold the door, someone to set up the classroom\n",
            "\" If you have alphas inside the classroom, utilize them because when their minds are busy, so are their hands\n",
            "In my classroom, everyone had a job, and the busiest ones had the most jobs because they're capable of doing multiple tasks\n",
            "Teachers often say, \"Oh, since COVID, these children are different\n",
            "\" I don't think they're different in a fundamental way; maybe they need more engagement\n",
            "Nowadays, cell phones and other technology engage students in many ways, often negatively\n",
            "How can we transform that into the classroom\n",
            "How can we utilize technology not just as a babysitter\n",
            "I see classrooms where the TV is on as background noise, and very little learning is taking place\n",
            "So, focusing on engaging your classroom is crucial\n",
            "Another important topic is utilizing outside play for learning\n",
            "I went to a great institution this summer, where the speaker taught us that at least 8 to 12 books should be read each day\n",
            "She showed us how to incorporate reading into transitions, like at the beginning and end of outside playtime\n",
            "Utilizing outside play as a learning opportunity is essential because some students learn best in the sunshine and while running around\n",
            "Teachers could be doing one-on-one instruction, teaching colors, exploring with students, and engaging in language modeling and conversations\n",
            "Some students respond incredibly well to the outdoor environment, and it's crucial to harness that\n",
            "So, the two key topics I think teachers need more professional learning on are classroom engagement and utilizing outside time for instruction\n",
            "And they don't even know they're learning\n",
            "But you're doing it through play\n",
            "Right now in my role, the greatest need is having an inclusion specialist who really understands inclusion\n",
            "We have so many providers and teachers calling for help, saying they can't teach their classrooms because of one challenging student\n",
            "This includes students who have been moved from classroom to classroom due to disruptions\n",
            "The greatest need is having someone who can help teachers understand inclusion and how to include a student who is truly autistic or has developmental milestones they are struggling with\n",
            "What do you need to implement into your classroom to reach that child\n",
            "First, you need to implement visual aids, pictures, and other tools to help that child understand and become part of the classroom\n",
            "Some students are present but haven't been reached\n",
            "We need resources to go out to classrooms, to teach teachers how to reach students who are truly on the spectrum\n",
            "We talk about inclusion, but are we really doing it\n",
            "Often, children are in corners, overwhelmed by sensory overload, with classrooms full of colors and charts that they can't process\n",
            "In my classroom, I would introduce one letter at a time\n",
            "There's no need for all 26 alphabet letters on the wall if students can't even recognize what an 'A' is\n",
            "Understanding the difference between rote learning and genuine literacy is crucial—reading to them and engaging with them meaningfully\n",
            "We need more resources to go out and teach this concept effectively\n",
            "I don't have enough resources to address this need adequately\n",
            "We have a Community Engagement Coordinator and a CCNR Coordinator who focus on family and community engagement\n",
            "We have a literacy event coming up on October 12th, and every quarter, we have something focused on literacy\n",
            "We roll these events out to our providers, giving them an opportunity to table at our events and meet with parents\n",
            "Our CCNR Coordinator also attends family events, such as family nights hosted by our providers, to talk about resources and engage with parents\n",
            "We provide tools like Marco Polo to our families, which is an addition to their existing curriculum\n",
            "It includes kindergarten readiness skills, and we offer it for free\n",
            "Families receive a card to sign on and create an account, allowing their students to access math, reading, literacy, and other activities every day\n",
            "We provide flyers to our providers to inform parents about this free resource\n",
            "Additionally, we have a book club where parents receive free books and can meet at locations like the library for reading sessions based on the book of the month\n",
            "Every student gets a copy of the book being read\n",
            "We consistently issue free books to our providers and families\n",
            "At every literacy event, like the one we had in July, each parent received at least 14 books\n",
            "We also ensure that books are available in Spanish to meet the needs of all families\n",
            "I don't think that we have really been intentional about VPK (Voluntary Prekindergarten)\n",
            "We have left it up to the private centers, which is okay, but are they really equipped\n",
            "Are they really trained\n",
            "Do they have the education to do this\n",
            "We should no longer rely on untrained caregivers\n",
            "Our community needs to implement VPK like they did with kindergarten\n",
            "Every school should have VPK, and that VPK teacher should partner with the kindergarten teacher\n",
            "Starting right there is crucial because we're losing time\n",
            "Most foundational information is gained by ages 4 or 5, and if we wait longer, we’ve already lost our students\n",
            "We should be investing in early learning\n",
            "We haven't done that on a district level within our community\n",
            "We made this investment once with kindergarten, probably when I was little, but now research shows that we need to go further and include VPK\n",
            "Policymakers and district leaders, that's who can make this happen\n",
            "But they often see this as babysitting\n",
            "First, they need to see it as learning\n",
            "They view having 4-year-olds at school as babysitting\n",
            "They don't want it at the schools, but until we reach down and say, \"Listen, we need to invest in our VPK,\" the numbers will remain the same because the people currently running VPK programs are just not equipped for literacy\n",
            "They take care of our students very well\n",
            "For example, my mom did a great job with my kids as the best babysitter ever\n",
            "She made sure they ate, were clean, and watched a little TV\n",
            "But literacy was not her focus\n",
            "That's why I decided, \"Okay, mom, they're 3, they're going to school now\n",
            "\" She asked why, since she took good care of them\n",
            "I explained they need to go to school to learn socialization, to talk, listen to books, explore, do projects, paint, and engage in conversations\n",
            "We need to create resources and find a way to implement VPK on a district level\n",
            "My name is Juan, so you Probably noticed\n",
            "I am the program coordinator for the Education Equalizers Foundation\n",
            "We are a college access network, one-stop-shop for all things\n",
            "College acceptance, ACT, SAT prep, FAFSA clinics\n",
            "We have our flagship program called College Pass over the summer\n",
            "It's actually happening right now\n",
            "It's every Friday in July\n",
            "We have our cohort this year\n",
            "Cohort is a little bit over 30, 32 people\n",
            "I think it is a little bit over that\n",
            "And we basically do every Friday in July a panel of speakers to talk to them about the importance of applying to colleges\n",
            "We guide them through how to do that, and we register them for our own ACT, SAT program to give them a benchmark, and then to help them work towards improving their score\n",
            "All things college guidance\n",
            "So that's what we're mainly for\n",
            "I'm originally from Miami, but I am a full-time student at UF now, as well as doing this\n",
            "It's already July, I began in January of this year\n",
            "So it's been 6 months\n",
            "Is that right\n",
            "And then I've been program coordinator since April\n",
            "Of course, I'm a political science and religion double major, and I'm minoring educational studies\n",
            "So EEF has never really had a specific program for literacy needs\n",
            "And I don't think we've ever had a completely detailed measuring of people's literacy level reading, writing level\n",
            "So I feel like we don't have enough like the proper data to answer that question exactly right\n",
            "But I will say that that is something we can begin looking at\n",
            "And our students come from mostly minority backgrounds\n",
            "So we have first-generation college students, first-generation Americans, African-American students\n",
            "And those aren't the only students we serve\n",
            "We're not exclusive to those groups\n",
            "But those are the people who have sought out our organization\n",
            "So it's who we've been helping the most\n",
            "And I will say that for first-generation American students there can definitely be some literacy issues, because sometimes their first language isn't English\n",
            "And so I think there can definitely be some issues with that\n",
            "Yes, absolutely\n",
            "We are pretty aggressive marketers of ourselves\n",
            "Right now, we actually have a WUFT and local NPR ad in Gainesville about our FAFSA clinic\n",
            "We send out mailers, are constantly updating our Instagram, and try to spread by word of mouth\n",
            "We're in the Alachua County public schools, trying to reach students there\n",
            "We're also trying to get into some churches to reach out to youth groups\n",
            "We are seeking out students everywhere and anywhere we can\n",
            "When it comes to literacy specifically, I think for applying to college and the ACT, these students do have a good level of literacy strong enough to get them through the college admittance process\n",
            "The more complex answer would be that thinking about their skills in all of their education and then getting into college is one thing, and how they will perform in college when they get there is a separate topic\n",
            "Some students might not be as strong in some areas after being accepted into college\n",
            "We try to prepare them for that in our College Pass program, talking about the difficulty level in college and what's going to change about the courses so students can prepare for that change\n",
            "A lot of students come to us in their senior year in a bit of a panic mode because they really want to get into college\n",
            "We try to figure out what we can do for them to get them to college, and we've had a 100% college acceptance rate so far\n",
            "Every student has gone to college\n",
            "We try to follow up with them as best we can, and most report that they are doing fine\n",
            "Anyway, to sum up my answer, because I've been talking long enough\n",
            "The interesting thing is that we've been around since 2021, so for 3 years\n",
            "Our first cohort theoretically hasn't completed college yet, so we are still following up with them\n",
            "Once we finish this year, we should get our first batch of results for that exact question\n",
            "We're still a very young organization\n",
            "I'm actually going to drop our website in the chat before I forget\n",
            "So we are going to try to follow up with them as best we can\n",
            "Obviously, phone numbers and emails could change\n",
            "If they can't get back to us, we will lose out on that data\n",
            "But we do follow up a year after our program\n",
            "For example, the students who completed our College Pass program in 2023 to 2024, we call them in about May to talk about how college is going, how their first semester went in the fall, and how the spring semester is going\n",
            "We try to follow up with them as best we can\n",
            "We have no literacy-specific program, and I included that on the survey\n",
            "But many of the skills we talk about in our program can help students with their literacy, especially in SAT or ACT prep, where we talk about how to read certain passages because you need those reading comprehension skills\n",
            "Exercises like that can help\n",
            "We write progress logs and ask students to discuss their progress\n",
            "These exercises can help students convey how they're feeling and learn how to talk about themselves\n",
            "The SAT, ACT exercises can help too\n",
            "Definitely\n",
            "Yes, absolutely, we're engaged with that whole process\n",
            "Students know that even after our July program, they can reach out to us\n",
            "We're reaching out to them, constantly offering events and opportunities, telling them to fill out applications or scholarships\n",
            "We have a big event in April and events scattered throughout the year\n",
            "We do professional headshots for them\n",
            "We keep up to date and follow up with them as they complete their senior year\n",
            "I wanted to say as well that I think a lot of it, and this can help with literacy as well, is empowerment\n",
            "A lot of these students feel demotivated to achieve\n",
            "Many have the skills but lack the motivation to go to college or don't think they can do it\n",
            "So a lot of what we do, in addition to the actual help, is motivating them and empowering them to achieve what they want\n",
            "We have panels of speakers\n",
            "This Friday, for example, we have the national recruiter for the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars coming to speak to students\n",
            "We provide opportunities for them to hear from successful people in the community and nationally, which helps motivate them to pursue college and put in all their effort\n",
            "Yes, when we talk about ACT or SAT prep, we have a specific dedicated tutor for them\n",
            "She provides thorough feedback and offers her services to our students at a much lower cost or for free sometimes\n",
            "Additionally, we have the essays, and our staff is very involved with education\n",
            "We have people from the Career Connection Center to talk about essays and resumes\n",
            "We have people who have been in education for quite some time looking at their essays and engaging with them as well\n",
            "Yeah, I think the easiest way to look at it is by numbers\n",
            "We talked about the 100% college acceptance rate and the 100% FAFSA completion rate\n",
            "All of our students are required to complete the FAFSA as part of our program\n",
            "The first week of College Pass, last Friday for us, was they take an ACT to have a benchmark because some of these students have never taken one before\n",
            "We establish a benchmark with them: \"This is where you're at\n",
            "Where do you want to be, and what amount of work is required to get there\n",
            "Yes, we have ways to measure their progress so that at the end of the year when they're finished with their senior year and moving on from the Education Equalizers, we could talk about their progress in terms of the amount of scholarships they have$100,000 worth of scholarships\n",
            "I think the number one thing I would say is for ESL\n",
            "It would be really helpful for our staff to receive some training in how to deal with students in ESL\n",
            "For me, it's very easy because I speak Spanish, so I just speak Spanish with them, and we work through all the college application stuff in Spanish\n",
            "Of course, they have to write their essays and take the ACT or SAT in English, but it's much easier to walk them through the instructions in Spanish\n",
            "For me, that's easy, but a lot of our staff might struggle because they don't know Spanish and might not know how to explain certain things to ESL learners\n",
            "So I think training in ESL could be really helpful to our staff and could bring more ESL learners to College Pass cause we have seen some, but we have not seen a lot compared to how we've seen first-generation college students and African American students\n",
            "I'm confirming with our director now\n",
            "She should answer me very quickly\n",
            "We got plenty of time\n",
            "I've just asked\n",
            "Because I think we might\n",
            "But we have seen mostly African American students\n",
            "And a lot of these students are also first-generation college students\n",
            "We start with 8th graders\n",
            "Our goal really is to get more 8th graders\n",
            "Obviously, of course, we've had mostly juniors and seniors complete our program so far, some sophomores sometimes, but juniors and seniors are the main people, because, you know, they get to that last stage of high school, and they realize, -oh, I need a lot of catch-up to do if I want to go to college\n",
            "Of course we help them with that\n",
            "But we would like to see more 8th graders, because if we could get students earlier and keep them for their whole high school career, starting 8th grade and moving up 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, we could really help them and achieve a lot with them\n",
            "Our director always likes to say every 8th grader should take the SAT\n",
            "She's really onto that\n",
            "They should take the SAT or ACT and should start figuring out the cost\n",
            "Because, even though that sounds really really early to a lot of people to be thinking about college, it happens so quickly and and like going through high school, all of a sudden\n",
            "One year, you know, at the beginning of your junior year, it's all of a sudden colleges, everything\n",
            "It's very important\n",
            "And so, you know, you have 3 years prior that you could be developing\n",
            "Yes, definitely, we have needs\n",
            "I was trying to think of how to word them in a more professional way\n",
            "But money is a real need for a lot of organizations that do work in literacy or work like ours—just fundraising as much as we can\n",
            "Give me one second\n",
            "So much more\n",
            "So what are those things that you needed need the funding for to support\n",
            "We have a number on our website that tells you how much it costs per day to support these students\n",
            "And I, for some reason now I can't find it, and I don't have it on hand\n",
            "But the money would help us with a lot of different things, with outreach to the community\n",
            "We have been growing at a very steady pace\n",
            "But we do want to keep growing\n",
            "And it it looks like the trend is turning towards growing at a much larger pace than we might be able to handle currently\n",
            "And we're gonna do our best\n",
            "And we've never denied anyone to this point\n",
            "You know, if someone needs help with something\n",
            "We will help them, but it obviously becomes harder, and not everyone can do the Fridays in July, because those are a little more\n",
            "That's a little more of an expensive program\n",
            "They don't have to pay for it, but it costs us more\n",
            "And so that would help us with supporting the College Pass program that would help us with the SAT/ACT prep\n",
            "I talked about how the sessions for those are at a reduced rate, but if we could get them for free for students\n",
            "That would be amazing\n",
            "Of course, that means paying our staff member from ourselves because she can't just work for free\n",
            "I think another need\n",
            "That's a little better answer than just money\n",
            "staffing is definitely\n",
            "If we could just have a bunch of people who would love to volunteer all their time all the time, that would be great\n",
            "But we do have an amazing staff of volunteers and some really great staff members\n",
            "But if we keep growing at the rate we're going, we're going to need more people on our staff to help us\n",
            "I would say 8 to 10 people currently, who are like fully engaged, fully trying to go to any event that they can\n",
            "Trying to help students any way they can\n",
            "trying to be at College Pass\n",
            "But we're also in libraries doing FAFSA clinics\n",
            "We're at events all over Gainesville\n",
            "We're extending into Lake County now\n",
            "So there's a lot going on, and more staff members would definitely help that\n",
            "We have about 50 plus students apply for College Pass this year, and we were able to take in around 30\n",
            "We just got a generous donation so we can take in 6 more students\n",
            "When it comes to someone who might need help filling out the FAFSA or figuring out how to apply for an SAT or ACT, we will answer and help them, even if they're not part of our cohort for that year\n",
            "So even if they can't join College Pass and experience the entire program, if they reach out to us for specific needs, we can definitely do something to help\n",
            "A lot of our staff just works really hard\n",
            "Our founder and director, Dr\n",
            "Karji Scott, works full-time at Tennessee State University\n",
            "She does remote work, lives in Lake County, and comes to Gainesville to help out, so she's everywhere\n",
            "We have a staff member from the Career Connection Center who helps us out\n",
            "The way we build capacity is by working together\n",
            "No one person alone is doing these events because doing them alone would be too much work\n",
            "Doing them together really helps; even if something should be done by four people, having it done by two is a lot better than just one\n",
            "So when we work together, we can get a lot done\n",
            "Having done the College Pass program for three years has really helped our staff members who have been around since the beginning of EEF\n",
            "With more staff members, the process could be smoother because we have experienced staff members to guide them\n",
            "But right now, with our limited staff, we are still able to accomplish everything we're trying to accomplish by working together and with experience\n",
            "Community is a very, very, very important factor in our College Pass program, and in the other opportunities we provide for students\n",
            "The College Pass program takes place at the Santa Fe Blount Center\n",
            "And we have community members come to speak to them all the time\n",
            "We have organizations that we partner with, and they come and speak to them\n",
            "So we have people from 100 Black Men\n",
            "I don't know if you've heard of them\n",

            "I think one of the things that we emphasize with the PAT (Parents as Teachers) program, is school readiness which is one of their goals\n",
            "And because of that, we really encourage parents, with our parent-child interaction, to read to their children\n",
            "That's why we provide them with new books\n",
            "talking to them, getting that vocabulary exposure\n",
            "You'll start to see even with reading, singing, talking, storytelling, those types of things, children try to learn and mimic\n",
            "So during the home visits, you'll start seeing kids that they'll be reading their books\n",
            "Yeah, they might be reading from back to front, but they're looking at the pages, pointing out different things\n",
            "So I think that really lays a good foundation for literacy early for the children\n",

            "I don't necessarily know about tracking literacy skills since it's not like you're going to sit down and do a test with a parent, but different ways to bring up the subject, discuss it, and provide resources in the community that could help would be helpful\n",

            "we can all over it and then get a refresher\n",
            "I think that that's very helpful for a lot of people, because sometimes it's just like you do it, and you're all passionate about it\n",

            "You expose them to the concept, and then you apply the meaning to the activity or to the concepts after the fact, so that they are placing the vocabulary  on an experience, not on a preconceived notion of how the incomplete definition appears in their brain\n",
            "This is a very difficult question for me because when you say literacy tools, I'm on the outskirts of the standard literacy tools\n",
            "I do not teach reading\n",
            "Our concepts and mechanisms are science education-based\n",
            "Our standards are derived from science literacy, so there is a connection to science literacy\n",
            "But because we're STEM-based and our goal is to get the students to truly understand the STEM concepts, we apply our literacy skills in a more experiential way by applying the vocabulary after the fact\n",
            "This approach is a derivative of science literacy, but not necessarily teaching how to read\n",
            "We teach how the words they are hearing apply to the concept so that when they get to reading about them later in their education, they have a fuller understanding and grasp of what they're reading\n",
            "Absolutely\n",
            "Our field is less about the reading and more about the science content\n",
            "Obviously, therefore, when you deal with low-level readers who believe because of the way science has been taught through words that they're not good at science, you find that there's a huge group of low-level readers who are actually very good at critical thinking skills and science\n",
            "They have just lost the confidence, I think, because they don't understand the words, but they're really good at the concepts\n",
            "So when you connect the concepts, and then they read about it, and they understand what's going on, the confidence level for that person in STEM and in their capabilities in understanding science increases\n",
            "We minimize the concept of, in my forensics course, for instance, in East Side I had low level students\n",
            "Teaching them STEM skills brought in a forensics course, because it was for the STEM skills, part of it a survey course\n",
            "Because in forensics you can do a little bit of physics, you can do biology, it's actually chemistry, it's everything like it's all the fields\n",
            "So it's a survey of the science fields but mostly a critical thinking skills concept\n",
            "It was to support their reading levels in the claim evidence, reasoning side of it\n",
            "Because in forensics your claim is clear, your reasoning is obvious why you're making that reasoning, and your evidence is very specific\n",
            "So if you want to apply the concept of claim evidence, reasoning and writing skills in a really fundamental way that's exciting, interesting, and understandable, and bring in the STEM concepts at the same time, you can do that in a forensics course\n",
            "So bringing that course into Electric County as a standard in high school, and it's still being taught at Eastside\n",
            "It was the first year when I brought it down from the State\n",
            "It was well received by the students, and all levels of student were in the course, but my low-level readers\n",
            "Instead of making them read and write, they were able to produce the standard crime boards where they can make the connections, and then after they made the connections on the picture boards, they could then delineate which part of that was their actual evidence, which was their inference, which went into their claim and the reasoning behind it\n",
            "It was a more structured way of taking their words and allowing them to communicate through a more visual, more tactile, and more real-world set of scenarios\n",
            "Then we could apply that to, okay, so when you're doing this writing and you're in your history class, the only difference is what you use as your evidence\n",
            "You know we were able to kind of make it universal for the writing side of it\n",
            "Because they experienced it, and it made it their own\n",
            "This is just as tried and true in the science field\n",
            "And I know that this doesn't go over to a lot of other fields that are primarily word-based fields\n",
            "But in the field it's very common that the experiential learning is the way to understand the concepts, because the concepts are so complex for words to describe, but are very simple to see\n",
            "You can watch something happen\n",
            "Convection, for example, you can watch it happen with dyes\n",
            "It would take like three paragraphs to explain what's happening, but yet it's happening right in front of you\n",
            "To try to teach that through a definition, you know, the transfer of energy as the motion of the fluid is raising due to the density difference, these are all big words\n",
            "Watch it happening, and then to apply that definition to it is so much easier in complex fields that are experiential\n",
            "To explain the difference between evidence and inference\n",
            "You know you could say to someone, \"I don't like the way that person's eyes look, therefore they're guilty,\" but you know that’s not going to hold up in court\n",
            "So is that evidence\n",
            "Or is that your inference from some other world that you're coming from\n",
            "These are the kinds of explanations you get\n",
            "\"Oh, he clearly did it, look at his eyes\n",
            "”\n",
            "Okay, he clearly didn’t based on his eyes, is that really gonna hold up in court\n",
            "There's a realness to it, a real-world applicability where the students can really discern their own thoughts, and apply what they mean by evidence to real evidence\n",
            "Learning by doing and being part of the actual hands-on activity gives them knowledge in a different way\n",
            "It allows them to take in knowledge not through words, which is their difficulty, but then practice giving it back through words\n",
            "Their literacy experiences are more positive because they have something to say\n",
            "And they know that they have to say it\n",
            "In a presentation, I can say to them, \"I know what you're saying because I'm here in the room, but if you use those words to someone who has no idea what you just went through with this process, would they believe you\n",
            "\" And the answer is no, because my words did not reflect at all what was being presented\n",
            "So giving them the meaning behind why words are important, and why the proper use of words and the proper presentation of words are necessary, gives them a reason or an understanding of what they’re trying to do with their presentations\n",
            "First, to capture those teachers that want to do hands-on activities because they're already an audience that's willing to try\n",
            "And then having them have more success in their classrooms because there's a stress level associated with doing hands-on activities\n",
            "You want to see the value coming from it\n",
            "You want to see the learning and the value\n",
            "If we could engage them in how to run and the purpose of running a hands-on activity, and then on the back end, show them how to take that enthusiasm and knowledge and put it into the communication that the students need to then go on and actually be successful in our modern-day classrooms, that's a skill set\n",
            "Usually, people that like to do hands-on activities do it for fun, or it's a treat for the students, or it's like cupcakes\n",
            "And then the \"bad\" kids, the quote, bad-behaved kids, have to earn the treat, and therefore they're the ones that get left out of the hands-on activity because they're not behaving in class\n",
            "The idea is those students that you're talking about that are supposedly not well-behaved are probably the ones that need it the most and are probably the ones that learn the best that way\n",
            "So to make them jump through these other kinds of hoops before they get a chance to be engaged in that and be successful in that kind of education is an issue I have in classrooms\n",
            "To explain or to encourage teachers to see that if a well-developed, well-administered hands-on activity could engage those students, wouldn't you want to do that\n",
            "Isn't that your goal\n",
            "Isn't your goal not to control their behavior but to redirect it into a positive excitement\n",
            "And that's what I think a really well-developed hands-on activity does\n",
            "The culture of learning through hands-on activity in the classroom is both challenging for the gifted learner who is very good in a traditional classroom because it's a challenge, and then for the poorly literate students, it gives them that confidence to learn\n",
            "Each one of them is learning where their challenges are\n",
            "I think that's an important part of learning\n",
            "Plus, especially, obviously, I'm going to focus on STEM skills\n",
            "It's really the STEM skills that are most experiential\n",
            "I need more people that do what I do\n",
            "I have found that there are many teachers that I have connected with that have given up on activities in the classroom because of the literacy focus\n",
            "You become a reading teacher in your classrooms and they teach you to do reading and reader literacy skills in order to help, but they're not allowing the STEM literacy skills\n",
            "There are literacy skills, and then there are STEM literacy skills, and they need to be combined in a STEM classroom\n",
            "I’m not talking about other classrooms because I’m not an expert in anyone else’s field\n",
            "I believe reading and words are very, very nice\n",
            "I love them\n",
            "And I just believe that our schools are too heavy in teaching through words\n",
            "We need to, especially for the STEM fields, if we're going to engage those people who are not word people, they're more real world people, we need to start that early, and that means that every child should have exposure to the real STEM field, which is experiential, and the words should come later\n",
            "A few years ago, a new directive came down, and I'm talking maybe 15 or 20 years ago\n",
            "A new directive came down from the Federal Government on what our STEM fields should be teaching, and it started with a STEM literacy book\n",
            "We went to the University of Florida, did a nice workshop with the Math and Science people, and we learned about the new standards, the common core standards that were coming down\n",
            "The standards for science have not really changed\n",
            "I don't care what you call them; they just don't change\n",
            "They are fundamental standards\n",
            "You can rearrange the words, but they are usually skills-based and content-based\n",
            "The focus shifted less from producing scientists and experiential learners and more towards the general population understanding the vast amount of knowledge that is out there from scientists because so much of our everyday lives are now affected by STEM words\n",
            "Right\n",
            "So our hands-on technology, pretty much everything\n",
            "Everywhere you look, people have to be knowledgeable about the advances in science, and it becomes a part of their everyday lives\n",
            "So this new set of standards said we're not just focused on producing scientists; we're focused on the general population understanding what scientists do\n",
            "That was integrated into the standards, and it still maintains because scientists make the standards, especially in Florida\n",
            "It still maintains a set of standards that is skills-based\n",
            "But the skills got minimized to the content, especially when you started doing the pacing guides and the pacing guides started having standardized quarterly tests going along with them\n",
            "All of a sudden, you had hardly any time to expose students to the experiential learning up front because you had to cover these topics\n",
            "For newer teachers especially, they were always linked to chapters in the textbook, which never really followed the standards\n",
            "Our textbooks are from different states and often don't follow the order, but they are used as the closest reference\n",
            "So you get this disjointed approach, \"We're gonna start with Chapter 3, then go back to 1, then down to 15\n",
            "\" It doesn't make any sense reading-wise because there is an order to a book\n",
            "But that's because science is not really meant to be taught through the textbook; it's there for reference\n",
            "It's meant to be taught skills-based\n",
            "It became very difficult for a lot of newer teachers to take a step back and establish a classroom that was STEM-oriented\n",
            "Plus, they started moving the science concepts younger and younger, such that fourth graders were learning about atoms\n",
            "Elementary school teachers who are not chemists do not understand what an atom is, and so they were learning as the student was learning because the last science they probably had was in high school\n",
            "Everything became not learning through experience, but learning through words at the earlier ages, which are very critical ages\n",
            "Whereas, they used to be doing gardens in school for science, or bringing home plants and doing observation skills\n",
            "What people would consider \"playtime\" is not playtime for a scientist\n",
            "There were issues with gifted classes where students would go out into the field to observe wildflowers\n",
            "The gifted students, who were good at reading and could pass standardized tests, got to do this, but when they came back, they would be asked to draw their wildflowers\n",
            "The teacher told me that almost all the drawings were the same stereotypical flower because that's a flower according to them\n",
            "They were not observing the wildflowers accurately\n",
            "Wildflowers don't all look like the stereotypical one\n",
            "There are many kinds, but the critical powers of observation of the real world were not engaged because the students weren't really looking\n",
            "And that's a problem for STEM fields\n",
            "All of our volunteers are closely monitored by Hands-on Gainesville staff\n",
            "Our volunteers, the people that we know can administer a hands-on activity in an engaging way, are carefully overseen\n",
            "We will actually go to the first few outreaches with the students and make sure, like, release them\n",
            "Release the volunteers of the groups that want to go out and do the STEM outreach, release them to the schools after we're assured that they understand the way to interact with the students\n",
            "We help them develop those hands-on activities that are engaging and meaningful\n",
            "That’s our role\n",
            "Our role in the volunteer effort allows us to spread out because we have a lot more outreach\n",
            "Oh, they ask for us\n",

            "We are by invitation, and our feedback has always been very positive\n",
            "We've never had a \"we don't want you to come back\" mentality\n",
            "We have a lot of groups that are repeat groups, working with us year after year because, on the college student side, they understand\n",
            "If you're a STEM person, you innately understand STEM\n",
            "On the college side, they know what they're doing with us is introducing STEM in a way that they would have really enjoyed as kids because they're scientists and went into that field for a reason\n",
            "So there is a connection\n",
            "We make connections with the STEM people that want to do outreach, and by default, they make connections with the students that they're outreaching to because they are science people\n",
            "We find that without us, a science person goes into an outreach and models what they know, which is, let's do a movie or a PowerPoint and let's bring a worksheet for the students because that's what they know science education is\n",
            "But when we flip it on them, they fall right into a really good model of activity\n",
            "First, chat with the students, and then they come back saying, \"And they knew this, and they're talking about that,\" and they're engaging in the actual communication\n",
            "As a classroom teacher, I would then take that enthusiasm for the hands-on activity and bring it into the literacy skills with foldables and mini board notes and all kinds of creative ways of documenting their vocabulary and remembering it\n",
            "And then, you know, making it into the communication skills that they would need\n",
            "We did so many different skills like tweeting for a while: \"Can you take this concept skill and tweet it into 144 characters\n",
            "\" There are a whole bunch of ways you can take what you know and then force them into using their words to communicate it, but they have to take what they know and do it\n",

            "It's just that what we have chosen to do, I believe, is focusing on students who are not successful in school and hitting their literacy skills hard because that's how students are successful in school – through literacy skills\n",
            "That’s one approach to success\n",
            "The other approach to being successful is giving the students who learn through hands-on activities the content knowledge they need so that when they struggle with the words, the words aren't so hard anymore, because they understand what the words are supposed to convey\n",

            "It has been after-school and summer programming\n",

            "I was not part of the original initiatives, but my understanding is that they were seeing a lot of students were not reading proficiently\n",
            "It was founded by current educators and principals in East Gainesville familiar with the community\n",
            "Since then Kids Count has grown from 3 days a week, serving 12 students, to serving 70 students each day at two different locations almost every single day school is in session\n",

            "Everything we do is completely free to our families\n",
            "We are majority funded by the Children's Trust, and also receive funding from the Alachua County CAP program, United Way, and smaller private donors\n",
            "We have worked with UF and the Lastinger Center to implement UFLI (University of Florida Literacy Institute) in our after-school space\n",
            "My calculations show we do an average of 48 hours of one-on-one individualized UFLI curriculum delivery each year\n",
            "Something I would love to see is increased usage of UFLI and ensuring we implement it with fidelity in an after-school space using trained volunteers and staff, who are not necessarily credentialed teachers or have literacy endorsements\n",

            "Honestly, in some ways, none of the things that I mentioned\n",
            "I think something we do really well is improving students' perception of learning in school, making learning fun, and showing that reading is fun\n",
            "Books are not our enemy\n",
            "We try to model that by showing the children what we’re reading in our personal lives\n",
            "We talk about how school is fun and share our own struggles and how we overcame them by practicing and getting better\n",
            "We see kids go from hating to go to school to loving school or at least enjoying it more\n",
            "I think that has been effective because it changes that student perception of learning\n",
            "When we tell them their tutors are coming, they get very excited\n",
            "Our kids are always asking, “When are the tutors coming\n",
            "” The volunteers sit down with the kids, doing UFLI lessons or homework help\n",
            "Working on the relationship students have with learning has been helpful because it allows us to use the tools and do the assessments\n",
            "We have classroom libraries, and getting the kids to choose reading a book in the reading corner over coloring is a significant achievement\n",
            "Some students even prefer reading a book over computer educational time\n",
            "I think it's about creating a culture around learning\n",
            "So myself and two program directors are full-time in the traditional sense\n",
            "Our part-time staff, by and large, are here a minimum of four days a week\n",
            "Many of them are here five days a week\n",
            "We prioritize hiring that way for continuity because we know that best practice is if we want kids to listen and be responsive, there has to be trust, relationship, and respect\n",
            "If people only work two days a week, they won't build that\n",
            "So many things change in one day\n",
            "Majority are UF students because our part-time hours from 12:30 to 5:30 are not conducive to someone working another job\n",
            "We get a lot of students pursuing education or youth development, or even recent graduates in that liminal space of deciding whether to go to grad school or looking for full-time work\n",
            "Yep\n",
            "And then full-time staff, my program directors, are there from 10:00 to 6:00, and I’m there from 8:00 to 6:00 or as needed\n",
            "We also try to retain staff year to year for increased continuity for the kids\n",
            "It doesn’t always work out with UF student schedules, but when possible, we have staff roll over from the previous year\n",
            "Our summer program is more like summer camp, although there might be an increased literacy component based on Children's Trust funding\n",
            "We want kids to keep reading through the summer\n",
            "It’s staffed by people who worked with us during the school year and are able to work during the summer\n",
            "We try to keep it as consistent as possible\n",
            "We don’t function the same way as many after-school programs because we are small\n",
            "Our maximum is 35 kids per site, and we keep classroom ratios really small at 1 to 12\n",
            "Our kids deal with high exposure to trauma and behavioral challenges, so we ensure our staff is patient, empathetic, and understanding\n",
            "Many of our kids come from deep poverty, with risk factors like community gun violence or incarcerated parents\n",
            "Having been in the community for 15-16 years, a lot of it is word of mouth\n",
            "We attend beginning of the school year events and prioritize 1st through 3rd graders based on the data\n",
            "We also accept more 4th and 5th graders this year because many weren't reading on grade level\n",
            "We attend back-to-school events with applications and talk to parents about the program\n",
            "Currently, we have a waitlist of 10-15 students at Metcalf and about five at Rawlings\n",
            "School personnel sometimes reach out to help get certain families into the program\n",
            "Yeah, because we provide transportation at the end of the school day\n",
            "For our Metcalf students, we provide van transportation to our location at Duval Early Learning in East Gainesville\n",
            "We rent the space from the district\n",
            "Similarly, Rawlings students stay at Rawlings\n",
            "We recently entered a lease agreement with Rawlings and the district for three portables, so we pick them up and walk them over\n",
            "We want it to be as accessible as possible, and transportation is a huge barrier\n",
            "If it’s right across the street from where the families live, they can walk and pick their kids up\n",
            "Just before\n",
            "Parents have to come pick up kids after the program\n",
            "But that's part of why we are where we are geographically\n",
            "We are close enough that parents can walk, bike, or drive\n",
            "Some families do have vehicles, but a lot of families live in the surrounding area, especially our Rawlings students\n",
            "There's a subsidized housing complex right across the street from Rawlings, and a lot of our students live there, so the parents just walk over\n",
            "If I had a bus, I definitely would drop kids off, but I don’t\n",
            "My immediate inclination is no, because as a smaller nonprofit, we have the flexibility\n",
            "As an executive director, I can say, “We’re putting a pause on this\n",
            "These kids are dysregulated, and it’s going to waste our time if we try to do UFLI right now\n",
            "Let's take a walk, reset, and try again\n",
            "” In a classroom setting, that's not feasible\n",
            "Principals and teachers are time-constrained\n",
            "I know other after-school programs like Girls Place also incorporate elements of what we do\n",
            "I met with their executive director about UFLI and how we implement it\n",
            "Elements of our program can be scaled, but Kids Count’s foundation is truly literacy-focused\n",
            "At a recent meeting with the State and Rawlings staff about their school data, I learned that only 5% of their 3rd grade students tested as reading proficiently on 3rd-grade state assessments\n",
            "They also had eight 3rd grade teachers that year—it's a revolving door\n",
            "For kids already in chaos, they don’t know which teacher they will have\n",
            "Some teachers also serve as resource behavior teachers and music teachers\n",
            "This systemic issue makes it challenging\n",
            "After that meeting, I wondered how to get more Kids Count people in schools with flexibility and understanding of trauma and youth development to support school efforts\n",
            "But reworking such structures is a big lift\n",
            "Really positive\n",
            "I’m on the school advisory committee with Rawlings and meet regularly with their administration team\n",
            "It’s a close partnership\n",
            "Similarly, the district supports us by leasing spaces to us, even though they don't have to\n",
            "This makes my job easier and helps us fulfill our mission\n",
            "The connection with Metcalf isn’t as strong\n",
            "It might be because I’m only one person with limited energy and time\n",
            "But if we email teachers for things like lost homework, they respond positively and send over copies for us to print out\n",
            "The relationship is there, and the district is very aware of the need, especially in East Gainesville\n",
            "For example, only 5% of 3rd graders at Rawlings tested as reading proficiently\n",
            "Rawlings is in turnaround due to years of low performance, compounded by factors like deep community poverty and the aftermath of COVID, which makes the challenge multifaceted\n",
            "Staff get much more training\n",
            "We conduct training on youth development, trauma-informed approaches, and neuro-sequential brain development (red brain, blue brain, green brain)\n",
            "This training ties into concepts like executive functioning and draws from Zones of Regulation and Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI)\n",
            "Although we lost funding for the free one-on-one play therapy we used to provide, we continue these practices\n",
            "I’ve received TBRI training and guide my staff accordingly\n",
            "Recently, I applied for funding for mental health training to have all my staff trained in TBRI, as it’s a recognized approach for working with highly traumatized kids\n",
            "Oh, yeah, and accessible training\n",
            "Sometimes opportunities are offered in the afternoon or require attending 8-hour sessions, which aren't feasible for college students\n",
            "Flexibility is key\n",
            "We also cover attachment styles (anxious, avoidant, disorganized), the goals of misbehavior, and classroom management tactics like understanding unmet needs driving behaviors (attention-seeking, desire for power and control, revenge, etc\n",
            ")\n",
            "Volunteers get a lighter version of the training since they are typically with us for about 10-20 hours a semester\n",
            "We cover best practices, such as patience, praising desirable behaviors, and handling students who struggle with tasks like spelling their names\n",
            "This also includes recognizing the shame and embarrassment that a third grader may feel about reading difficulties, which can result in them acting as the class clown\n",
            "We train volunteers on UFLI using online resources from the UFLI team and practice sessions with staff support\n",
            "We want to ensure volunteers know how to conduct each section correctly\n",
            "Additionally, students performing at or above grade level participate in what we call \"Book Club,\" focusing on reciprocal teaching strategies to improve comprehension and fluency\n",
            "I thought they were synonymous\n",
            "Good to know\n",
            "OK, good to know\n",
            "Yeah, we do online resources for UFLI and practice sessions\n",
            "For Book Club, which I haven't mentioned much, we base it on reciprocal teaching strategies to improve comprehension and fluency\n",
            "We also focus on making reading enjoyable\n",

            "Observation and support\n",
            "We'll do more training with us\n",
            "This is an area I'd like to grow in\n",
            "I mentioned earlier talking with Valentina Contesse to do more training\n",
            "While I have a background in education and youth development, I'm not credentialed or certified in literacy\n",
            "Supporting staff further so they can catch and correct volunteers when they might do a part too quickly or not reinforce a concept is essential\n",
            "I really like UFLI, and from what I've seen, it does positive things for our students\n",
            "It's easy to understand, but the science of reading is complex\n",
            "While our volunteers are passionate, they don’t have the background in literacy\n",
            "Understanding why UFLI is set up the way it is—like why heart words are different from consonant-vowel-consonants—is essential\n",
            "We've been using UFLI since I started, and I will begin my third year in December, so for two years now\n",
            "We've used other programs like Reading Pals before I came on board\n",
            "From what I've seen data-wise, children are growing and improving, and their relationship with reading is improving\n",
            "For example, a child who once kicked and screamed now loves picking out books from the library\n",
            "I would say probably 40% of the time is spent on redirection and social-emotional learning\n",
            "For instance, this is our first week with our volunteers, and we don’t actually do any UFLI activities with the kids\n",
            "It's focused on relationship building, so they can get comfortable with each other\n",
            "The hope is that when they do start UFLI next week, it will be less of a battle\n",
            "Prior to tutors coming back this week, our curriculum has involved staff reading with the kids and doing activities connected to text\n",
            "We've been doing homework with them since they came to us at the end of August\n",
            "We spend a solid amount of time on redirection or calming students down\n",
            "One element we haven't discussed due to time constraints is physical health issues\n",
            "Many of our kids come with heartbreaking dental hygiene issues, like extensive cavities or cracked molars with exposed roots\n",
            "These physical pain issues severely impact their ability to focus and be part of the class\n",
            "I had a little girl with 6 to 8 cavities and an exposed root\n",
            "The school expects her to read and do work, but it's challenging when a child is in pain\n",
            "She probably gets redirected and punished for that behavior\n",
            "Then, she comes to us having been told to sit down and be quiet, and we have the flexibility to provide gentle care and build trust\n",
            "We often have kids come in with blisters because they don’t have socks\n",
            "Recently, I solicited donations for dental hygiene items and socks because our kids don’t have them\n",
            "When they come in with large blisters, we can’t expect them to do their homework comfortably\n",
            "We try\n",
            "Schools do dental sealants and flu mist, but it requires parental consent\n",
            "Many parents can’t read the forms well\n",
            "Forms often go unreturned, and more extensive care like pulling teeth is challenging\n",
            "I’ve offered parents rides to dentist appointments and help with insurance, but the response varies\n",
            "We are mandated reporters for medical neglect, and we had to make a report for the little girl with the exposed root\n",
            "Some parents work two jobs and have limited capacity, while others might not care to read at all\n",
            "In an ideal world, we would have more full-time staff to do social work\n",
            "But we do what we can with what we have\n",
            "We see growth in our kids, which is the positive takeaway amidst many challenging factors like housing instability\n",
            "If I had another full-time staff member\n",
            "My two program directors support programming needs, volunteers, students, and parents\n",
            "Having another qualified person to devote time to training volunteers, recruiting qualified volunteers, or developing training systems would be a game-changer\n",
            "We've had volunteers this semester who couldn't attend orientation, so I made a voice-over video, but that took time and energy\n",
            "Having someone focused on this would be incredibly beneficial\n",
            "Our families are wonderful, and we have good engagement\n",
            "We try to do two family events a year, if not more—like Christmas events where families make crafts, and we give away books and gifts\n",
            "In the spring, we have an end-of-year celebration\n",
            "At these events, we provide food, crafts, and books, and give families time to connect\n",
            "We serve many single-parent households, and connecting with other parents in similar situations is beneficial\n",
            "All our families are invited on field trips, and we cover any associated costs and provide transportation if needed\n",
            "For example, we were supposed to go to the Santa Fe Planetarium on Friday, and in the past, we've had 5-6 parents join us\n",
            "Over summer, we see even more parent engagement with activities like swimming pools and bowling alleys\n",
            "I also go into schools with parents to advocate during 504 meetings and IEPs if they have concerns\n",
            "I act as a resource, take notes, or just provide support\n",
            "Last year, I attended several of these meetings\n",
            "Many of our kids have IEPs or would qualify, and the process is nuanced\n",
            "Schools are often resource-constrained, so supporting both families and schools with the IEP process has been something I enjoy from a policy and equity perspective\n",
            "Long story short, family engagement is good but could be better\n",
            "That is hard\n",
            "There are so many systems working in silos\n",
            "I know agencies like the United Way have the campaign for grade-level reading, the Lastinger Center is doing things, and the school district is trying\n",
            "Bringing all these systems together to say, \"What's working and what's not\n",
            "How can we leverage individual strengths and assets to better serve kids\n",
            "For example, I've been in meetings where schools say, \"We sent the form home\n",
            "\" But did they engage with the parent\n",
            "Did they explain what the form said\n",
            "Did they try multiple times\n",
            "There's a capacity issue too—if parents are working and the school is calling during their work hours, there's a disconnect\n",
            "Understanding where the silos are, finding a way to break them down is key\n",
            "The school district is aware we're using UFLI because I mention it, but how could they support us better\n",
            "For example, I pay rent to be in these buildings—money that could go towards hiring more staff or a mental health counselor\n",
            "Collaborating better to do this work more efficiently is crucial\n",
            "Family engagement is also essential\n",
            "Many parents we work with view the school district as the enemy due to historical and institutionalized racism issues\n",
            "Building trust with schools is hard\n",
            "We need to support parents in building bridges and understanding educational materials\n",
            "Some UFLI worksheets are challenging, even for those with advanced degrees\n",
            "Listening to families and considering how to support them better is crucial\n",
            "Somewhat anecdotal\n",
            "We do anonymous surveys at the end of every semester or whenever someone exits the program, as required by the children’s trust\n",
            "But I don’t know that it gets to the heart of things\n",
            "Informal data often come from meetings or parent pickups where we learn things like a parent was in jail, and that’s why a sibling has been picking them up\n",
            "Kids also share, and training helps us understand and predict behavior disruptions\n",
            "I'd love to get an Americorps VISTA to help with these, but it comes down to capacity and time\n",
            "I want to advocate better for families but must balance this with our long-term commitment and boundaries\n",
            "Yes, technology and Internet accessibility can be an issue\n",
            "I think either of our partner schools would be more than happy to host\n",
            "I don't know what space you would need or want, or how many facilitators, but our spaces are also available after our programming ends at 4:45\n",
            "We have at least three classrooms at each location that can be used\n",
            "So I am Kelly Warm\n",
            "I work at the multidisciplinary training program at Uf\n",
            "Health\n",
            "I'm an educational consultant here\n",
            "I've been here for 2 years\n",
            "So what I basically, a quick synopsis of what I do here is our program is DOE-funded\n",
            "Kids K through 12 come here, and are evaluated for different reasons, and I compile the information, the results of their background history, and the results from those evaluations and come up with a plan of ways to support their family and teachers in evidence-based practices in 13 districts\n",
            "So I work all through North Central Florida, including Alachua County\n",
            "For Swag, I am a board member and I was part of the team that developed their summer program\n",
            "I've been kind of on consult with any educational thing that they've done over the last few years, and I've been on the board since 2020, so for 4 years\n",
            "Yes, it was literacy focused\n",
            "And they do have a tutoring program throughout the year\n",
            "But that focuses on math and literacy\n",
            "Okay, so in MDPT program, I, when I meet with schools in whatever district I'm in, I usually provide IES practice guides or something that we typically provide, some UFLI resources at times, some orthography resources\n",
            "I'm trying to think\n",
            "And then you're asking what worked best\n",
            "It's hard for me to say what has worked best, if I'm going to be honest with you, because I don't see the whole process through\n",
            "You know, I share the resources, and we don't always reassess necessarily after those resources are shared\n",
            "I will get feedback of progress at times, like teachers will send me standardized test scores or things like that, or anecdotal things or families will send me that, but I don't know that it's directly related to those particular resources\n",
            "I think I'm okay\n",
            "For Swag, we did some training for the teachers for the summer program, and we based that primarily on UFLY\n",
            "So we did some beginning of the program testing to see where kids were\n",
            "We showed the teachers how to tailor that information, take that information, use UFLY to be very targeted in their instruction, because they only have 2 weeks with these students, and they were all primarily struggling readers\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "They used a different tool to see the results\n",
            "In the first session, I did do that\n",
            "It's 2 weeks, so moving the needle is pretty difficult\n",
            "But what I did see is a lot of the kids gained confidence, and they knew the process a little bit better\n",
            "I think just even gaining that confidence, I could see a little bit of an increase in their capacity to attend to the task\n",
            "So that's more what I would say\n",
            "I don't know that they're hugely better readers in 2 weeks with 2 hours a day, 4 days a week\n",
            "Maybe it's a little more frequent than that\n",
            "But I do think it gave them a structured program, and it did give them some supports in other ways too\n",
            "So that is not something MDTP program does\n",
            "That's just not in our scope of work\n",
            "But for Swag, we came in and trained the teachers\n",
            "Following up on that summer program for the tutoring program, I met with a team, and we thought out some ways to structure the program and provide some supports, and some ways to target the literacy aspect\n",
            "I met with the educational person who works there and talked about some diagnostic tools and structure to a very short amount of time with very little hands on deck\n",
            "They were going to use that information to help train the volunteers who were coming in\n",
            "So I think I do need a clarifying question\n",
            "You mean, I'm assuming you're not related to educational standards, just like our scope of work standards\n",
            "Okay\n",
            "So in MDTP program, we are very cognizant that everything has to be evidence-based\n",
            "There has to be research behind it\n",
            "We don't use things that are just recommended, and we recommend the same things with fidelity\n",
            "So again, those IES practice guides, FCRR resources, we use Reading A-Z\n",
            "Those are some tools that we use\n",
            "The standard we use, again, is right\n",
            "So we typically use the Woodcock-Johnson and some other speech and language testing\n",
            "We put all that information on a profile graph, as Amy mentioned, and we use those scores, the overall picture of that child as a learner, or how they function in a classroom to inform our recommendations\n",
            "Follow up back to those evidence-based recommendations\n",
            "All of our recommendations are based on evaluation\n",
            "We get a lot of history about a child\n",
            "We take a lot of time to compile every aspect of the information we have with the evaluation scores to make sure we encompass all the areas and make our recommendations based on all that information together\n",
            "So I'm gonna say, I don't feel like I can speak to that quite as well because I'm not there on the day-to-day\n",
            "Again, I'm more consulting with them as a board member, hearing how things are going, and giving input on some potential, more of the structure of the program\n",
            "So I don't feel like I can answer for them\n",
            "Maybe I could follow up and ask Stephanie, who does implement everything, what that looks like\n",
            "I'm trying to think\n",
            "The standards I would say they use for choosing a student, choosing who they're going to work with\n",
            "They have to commit to attending all the sessions\n",
            "They usually go to the summer camp before, so they funnel right in because attendance is sometimes an issue in that community\n",
            "They want to make sure the time and resources are being utilized\n",
            "So that's a standard they use\n",
            "I think it's a work in progress\n",
            "That diagnostic piece was not always there, and the post-testing was not always there\n",
            "I think it was less developed in other years\n",
            "Speaking of this past year, using those things and basing the instruction on those very targeted areas, because it's such a short amount of time, is a standard that I think will continue to happen\n",
            "I would say, because the program only started in 2020, it's been a work in progress\n",
            "I think we're getting there for having more standards and more of a procedure of things\n",
            "Orthography and morphology, for\n",
            "I find, and ways to support second and beyond early readers, that they are actually going to buy into and are implementable within the structure of a secondary school day\n",
            "That's really a challenge for me, for MDTP program, to provide that kind of support and find that kind of support\n",
            "I would also like language\n",
            "I think more information about language impairments, how that impacts some instructional strategies that partner with that\n",
            "Those would be my two areas that I think I would like to learn more about, and perhaps others\n",
            "The orthography, I'm not going to say as much for Swag\n",
            "The language piece, yes\n",
            "I think the language piece and more trauma-informed behavioral interventions\n",
            "Swag is doing a really great job this year, so that educational person partners with all the schools that serve that community and gets information from those schools\n",
            "They share information so she can really support them\n",
            "I would say the language piece for Swag, for sure, and maybe some evaluation that they could do there so they could help the kids get access to the resources or be identified with the learning issues they might or might not have\n",
            "More of us\n",
            "More time, more people\n",
            "Which I know is a big ask\n",
            "But to be honest with you, we have a small but mighty team\n",
            "We serve 13 districts, and there are three of us\n",
            "I think probably the same thing\n",
            "For Swag, they could probably use some more tools in their toolbox\n",
            "I have access to a lot of things here\n",
            "Some training on different evaluations and different learning neurodiversity type things would be helpful\n",
            "But yeah, I think just being able to hire another person to do the educational piece at Swag\n",
            "She works for Swag, but she also works a few days at the Child Center and visits schools a day a week\n",
            "That's very little time to devote to the tutoring program, the planning of it\n",
            "The volunteers are inconsistent\n",
            "I think probably consistent training for volunteers is needed, so they have to go through some training and actually know how to implement the things that will help the kids\n",
            "MDTP program, we are doing the LETRS training right now\n",
            "So I would say that's pretty supportive of that\n",
            "We have a lot of resources here that are accessible to us\n",
            "So I think that's how they build our capacity\n",
            "The Swag piece, I think that’s probably an area of development\n",
            "Even meeting with Stephanie, who's doing this role, I did by my own accord, like I just was like, I'll help her do this\n",
            "There's not a ton of capacity building, I don't think\n",
            "She is an educator, but it's very different being an educator in a classroom and then doing targeted instruction to kids, especially for a short amount of time\n",
            "In my role in MDTP program, I support the families and the schools\n",
            "I meet with them, and I provide support in some of the activities\n",
            "If I recommend something to them, I try to have a follow-up with them and see if they implemented it, if they need support implementing it\n",
            "So that's kind of me\n",
            "And then if they need school-based support in that area, I make that connection\n",
            "For Swag, again, small program\n",
            "I'm not quite sure if that's developing at this point\n",
            "I am the Alachua County person here for MDTP program\n",
            "I reach out to the schools where I have a child on my caseload\n",
            "So I initially reach out to the schools and offer collaborative consultation\n",
            "Through that, I've developed relationships with different schools in Alachua County\n",
            "That's really it—collaborative consultation\n",
            "I get some opportunities to be in classrooms and sometimes support in IEP meetings or other things like that\n",
            "For Swag, it's those days that Stephanie is going to the schools\n",
            "The schools are invited every time they have a back-to-school event, a family night, or something like that\n",
            "The schools that serve that area are always invited to be represented and keep that connection with those children and the community\n",
            "The center itself, and then she is going there, I think, at least once a week—not to each school once a week, but to one of the schools once a week—to find out how they can support each other\n",
            "That's a new piece, and I think it's a really, really good one\n",
            "So with MDTP program, that's not really something in our scope of work\n",
            "Because of this unique situation, I did get the opportunity to establish a partnership between MDTP program and Swag this last summer, but I don't know if that will happen again because we have a very small team, and it's a pull on our resources\n",
            "We couldn't do it in all the districts we serve; it's just not possible\n",
            "Swag, I think they use\n",
            "I know they had UFLY come in and train their tutors a few years ago, so all the tutors were using UFLY\n",
            "They partner with the Children's Trust, so I think there's a lot of help through that, and then our partnership\n",
            "There might be more that I'm just not aware of because I'm not in all those conversations\n",
            "Yes, you're right\n",
            "And then the other organizations, they have to be literacy-based because we also like CARD and CAN\n",
            "And thinking that through, yeah, CARD, CAN, we don't say who, but a speech and language pathologist, follow up with them, or sometimes LIPS, some of those multimodal programs\n",
            "So through MDTPP program, we kind of try to\n",
            "they don't necessarily partner, but we use those as resources\n",
            "I think identification of, assessment, early on of possible reading challenges is crucial\n",
            "Being more informed in that area is important\n",
            "I think training for that language piece that I wasn't really aware of till I moved into this position is essential\n",
            "Understanding how ADHD and different neurodiversities impact learning is critical\n",
            "I'm not sure teachers in our community or any community are supported adequately in that growth area\n",
            "For a lot of struggling readers, identifying those neurodiverse needs and using best practices to support their learning would probably help the community quite a bit\n",
            "I think a more structured plan for support for the schools in our community would be beneficial\n",
            "Alachua County has reading coaches now, and some of those things are coming\n",
            "But I think having a real plan on how to use them, who they're supporting, kind of a scope and sequence of that area of work, and giving them specific curriculum and tools to use would be helpful\n",
            "Then tracking that progress and figuring out if you need to go a different route—just being very deliberate in that support\n",
            "I would think the school, you know, I think the school district\n",
            "So I think, you know, we know Alachua County has one of the largest equity gaps\n",
            "A lot of our kids are still very much struggling readers\n",
            "Identification of those issues earlier, like I said before, and then providing more targeted support—not necessarily doing the same thing with more frequency and fidelity, I think, would probably help\n",
            "Hopefully, that can make a difference\n",
            "Okay\n",
            "so my name is John S\n",

            "Motivate You of North Central Florida is a nonprofit training organization\n",
            "We work with agencies that serve youth\n",
            "I've been working for Motivate You since 2006, and in 2019, we were officially recognized and registered as a 501(c)(3)\n",
            "In that role, we provide life skills and social-emotional skills to agencies throughout the county and state that work with youth\n",
            "Our programs through Motivate You are all curriculum-based\n",
            "We work with kindergarten through 5th grade for one program called \"I Matter\n",
            "You Matter\n",
            "We Matter\n",
            "\" For upper elementary, middle, and high school students, we have programs called \"Living Large\" and \"Real Essentials\n",
            "Because these are curriculum-based programs, we have assessments, role plays, and case studies\n",
            "During those sessions, we provide opportunities for our participants to actively read and discuss the content from the program\n",
            "However, we do not have a specific initiative or curriculum solely devoted to literacy\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "The curriculum has a 16-hour train-the-trainer program where we take each of the attitude guides through a session to familiarize them with our curriculum\n",
            "When they are actually delivering the program, they have 4 sessions to observe a senior staff member go through the content\n",
            "Once they are comfortable, they may be the lead facilitator with trained facilitators there to provide support\n",
            "Okay, so I can give you the measurements for determining effectiveness\n",
            "But again, it may not directly relate to the literacy component\n",
            "Alright\n",
            "So when we are interacting with our participants, we're looking for engagement\n",
            "We're looking for their participation to see if they are grasping our concepts\n",
            "Each session we do reviews of the previous week's lessons to make sure they're comprehending it\n",
            "So those are methods that we use to measure how well we are, the information being transferred to the participants\n",
            "As far as the staff themselves\n",
            "Again, student engagement, student feedback, classroom management\n",
            "Those are all things that we use to determine how effective our attitude guides are in delivering our content\n",
            "I would\n",
            "I think that our staff could benefit learning more about the mental wellness component of the students that we're serving\n",
            "If I'm understanding your question, we're not trained to assess mental stability or mental concerns\n",
            "Sometimes that comes up in conversations with our participants, and in those cases we would defer back to the actual agency that we support who come in as an enrichment provider\n",
            "But I know that because of the population that we're serving, there are a lot of concerns and needs for that age demographic\n",
            "I think we could probably benefit from additional training in that area\n",
            "Okay\n",
            "So in my role as the President CEO of this organization, our greatest need is multi-layered, but it all revolves around securing funding so that we can go out and serve other people in the community\n",
            "Right now our primary funder is the Children's Trust of Alachua County\n",
            "We do have other agencies, such as United Way and other places, who supported us\n",
            "But the demand for the work that we're doing is much greater than the amount of funds that we have to serve them\n",
            "The requesting agencies communicate to us that they do not have the funds to pay for us to come out and do the work\n",
            "An example\n",
            "One specific example\n",
            "There is one organization who this year for this school year wants us to do multiple day sessions\n",
            "One wants us 4 days per week, 2 hours per day, and another wants us 2 hours per day, twice a week\n",
            "We need another who needs us 2 days per week\n",
            "Because of the contract with Children's Trust, if we were to provide the services to those organizations as they request them, it would exhaust all of our funded sessions\n",
            "Our biggest impact, I think, is during the summer camp time, when we're able to work with these children during out-of-school time\n",
            "So funding would be, in my role, the biggest need that we have\n",
            "That is not one of our primary focuses\n",
            "We do not again have that as a primary focus\n",
            "However, when we are made aware of external agencies who are serving that particular need\n",
            "We do communicate that to our participants, and we encourage them to go and share that information with their families\n",
            "So I think more from a support position\n",
            "We partner with other organizations\n",
            "But we do not have it primarily as one of our areas of focus\n",
            "So\n",
            "And that's an area where I think we will excel\n",
            "We have because we've served as an enrichment provider for multiple years\n",
            "And because of that, we have established relationships\n",
            "And we, I think our organization has earned a reputation for being a dependable, reliable resource for those enrichment services\n",
            "That's one of the reasons I think we continue to get those requests for services that I was referring to earlier, where people want us to come out and serve them\n",
            "But being able to pay us to do so is a challenge\n",
            "Again, we because we are in the community because we have served on so many different places\n",
            "We attended those, the group at the Children's Trust, where we try to attend tabling events of the other youth servicing agencies\n",
            "And I think that relationship, the relationship that we've established for summer camp\n",
            "I think that's one of the things that we're doing to continue to strengthen those relationships and where possible, to support\n",
            "I don't think I have an answer specific to a solution\n",
            "Because when a family values literacy, or when a family values education, they put forth the effort to make sure that those who are in that family are getting the resources they need\n",
            "When education falls on the priority of that family, I don't know if there's anything that the community can do to strengthen or bring attention to that need\n",
            "But I will say, and this is again my opinion, that if we are in the community, with the schools and with those after-school programs committed to offering opportunities to expose youth to different ideas that they would not probably hear as a part of regular conversation at home, I think we're reaching them\n",
            "Many times, if we are effective in reaching the child, it becomes more of an issue or desire for the child\n",
            "Sometimes the parents would entertain it and be open to trying something different\n",
            "But it's at the family level\n",
            "When the families value it, nothing can stop them\n",
            "When the families don't value it, there's very little that we can do to cause it to rise on their priority level\n",
            "I've been accused of thinking a little bit differently than many people\n",
            "So I'm going far left on this response\n",
            "We have an epidemic in our community now, and literacy has not risen to the point where I think it's drawing attention to it that can combat some of the concerns about the youth violence\n",
            "And so I'm going somewhere with this\n",
            "How you all edited I don't know, but I think that if we gave as much attention and support to those areas, those groups, those communities who are doing things, the way that we want them to do them in the community\n",
            "They're following the rules\n",
            "They're obeying the laws\n",
            "They're not going out and harming others themselves\n",
            "But because they're doing things the right way, sometimes they get ignored\n",
            "But if we offered incentives to reward those people who are doing things the way that we want people behaving, and as opposed to devoting all of our attention to those who may be running a little bit left of what we want\n",
            "That may be the motivation that somebody needs\n",
            "What am I saying\n",
            "If we gave, we typically get the behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated\n",
            "And so if we rewarded our students who are doing things, who are in school, who are attending school, who are bringing home the grades, that will make parents proud\n",
            "If we had a system where we could reward those and the families for providing that environment for the children, I think we could get more of the children who are doing those things\n",
            "Right now, a lot of attention is being devoted to the people who are not doing things to try to stop them from doing things that they should not be doing\n",
            "But what about the people who are doing things that we want\n",
            "What can we do to support or reward them\n",
            "I don't know if I have an answer to that\n",
            "But I will\n",
            "We have okay\n",
            "And again, so you have to give John a chance to just be John\n",
            "We have athletic programs that are being supported\n",
            "We have other external activities that are being supported\n",
            "There's funds out there for some things\n",
            "How we're allocating those funds\n",
            "Maybe we reallocate them\n",
            "I would like to think that\n",
            "And it doesn't always have to be a financial award\n",
            "But sometimes we're just recognition\n",
            "We have an athlete of the year, athlete of the week, where we have private founders who will recognize them\n",
            "But we have so many children who are, and families who are just doing the right things or doing them the right way\n",
            "And what attention are we giving to them\n",
            "So what resources\n",
            "We have banking institutions\n",
            "We have Channel 20 or PBS news, or whatever\n",
            "There are opportunities\n",
            "It's just, are we going to be creative enough as a community to identify how to again reward the behavior that we want to be repeated\n",
            "First of all, thank you for an opportunity to share and to let John kind of be John\n",
            "I'll end with this, and it's kind of rehashing my last, probably 5 minutes\n",
            "There was a joint meeting between the Children's Trust and the Board of County Commissioners, and a lot of attention was given to diverting our youth from the violent episodes that we're experiencing\n",
            "They said they've identified about 700 people in the community who are responsible for a lot of that violence or criminal activity\n",
            "We have 240,000 plus residents in Alachua County\n",
            "The percentage of those engaging in violence is very low\n",
            "That means a lot of our children are going to school, doing what they're supposed to do\n",
            "If we can come up with some means of recognizing and rewarding those individuals\n",
            "We still will probably have some people who are going to just decide to not do things the right way\n",
            "But those individuals who are on the fence, and they know that they, too, can be acknowledged, that may be all that they need to keep them from going and doing things that are undesirable\n",
            "mentioned at that meeting that we're not losing our children only to gun violence\n",
            "We're losing our children to overdose, self-harm, and vehicle accidents\n",
            "There are so many other areas where we still need to give attention other than just gun violence\n",
            "While I understand that's the epidemic now, we can't ignore it\n",
            "But at the same time, we need to look for something to keep children from getting caught up in the legal system\n",
            "And where literacy comes into helping to be a part of the solution, I can't say\n",
            "But as a community, we have to look for something\n",

            "Not in its entirety\n",

            "We don't offer that specifically here, however, we do tie into our State alliance  literacy opportunities\n",
            "So in the past, we have partnered with United Way’s Reading Pals to work with kids in our summer camp\n",
            "And then we applied for a grant through our State Alliance under a literacy summer camp that incorporated our partnership with Reading Pals\n",
            "So that's what we've done\n",
            "In our summer camp, we add a literacy component to ensure children are reading and doing activities at the same time, just to keep their minds going\n",
            "It’s not what they would probably need from a full-blown literacy program\n",
            "But at least we implement something to continue the thought process in regards to reading\n",
            "During the school year, the whole focus will be on New Worlds Reading\n",

            "Only to an aspect because New World is kindergarten to 5th grade only\n",

            "This summer we encountered through our summer camp a young man who was 12-13 years old, which is in that middle school demographic\n",
            "Basically, he had behaviors that do not fall in alignment with our core values, and what we found out was he could not read\n",
            "And so now he's in 6th-7th grade and can barely read\n",
            "He is way below the average\n",
            "And so he compensates by inappropriate behavior, whether he's bullying or picking on people, because of the insecurities of him not being able to\n",
            "Yes, I mean, I'm pretty sure we ran across that, but I'm pretty sure you will find a high percentage of children that may have behavioral issues within middle school\n",
            "It's because they can't read\n",
            "And so they've been passed along, and that's the biggest issue\n",
            "No, I have not\n",
            "I can't say that because we're on the education awareness aspect to tell the communities that there are resources available\n",
            "But what I can share is because we do\n",
            "We will have part of that as an introduction on our tabling events that we do\n",

            "We don't have the access to that data\n",
            "It is because that's part of how it works\n",
            "So in that it's all about families\n",

            "So when we host them, it's specifically staffing\n",
            "And so when we host it, the staff is trained in how to administer it, and we get our training through our state alliance\n",

            "There's not a massive amount of turnout for certain things in this community\n",
            "One parent workshop we did, we had probably 25 people register, and none of them showed up\n",
            "And then on the second one we had 37 people actually come\n",
            "So this community is a little bit more difficult to get people to come in\n",
            "In regards to opportunities, opposed to counties that have nothing\n",
            "Honestly, I don't know\n",
            "I mean there's so much so I will tell you\n",
            "There's so many people that you see on social media, so many organizations that are trying to do stuff with free\n",
            "So it's like you have all these nonprofits and founders who have now turned to reading, and everybody's hosting a reading event\n",
            "Unless a parent feels that they need it, you can't force parents to attend anything\n",
            "Ultimately, it comes back on the parent and caregiver because there's a lot going on in this community, and the parent has to choose where they want to go, if they want to go\n",
            "It would probably make life a lot easier\n",
            "But I will tell you there is no county-wide, no city-wide calendar\n",
            "So that impacts everything\n",
            "So we have a large number of nonprofits in this community who basically are all going after the same dollars or trying to reach out to the same demographics or offer same resources\n",
            "But you don't know who's doing what unless you're speaking to them\n",
            "So you may only have a certain group that you have relationships with cause they're kind of in alignment with where you go, that you'll know what they're doing\n",
            "So you can stay away from their events or work to partner or collaborate with their events\n",
            "But then you may have 75 other nonprofits that are doing similar things that you will have no clue about because there's no communication system that promotes collaboration and partnerships in order to know what's going on\n",
            "I don't\n",
            "The only thing I could probably recommend on it would be, and it's capacity\n",
            "Cause a lot of organizations just don't have capacity, as it relates to staffing, to do all the work\n",
            "I know it was presented probably a few years ago in regards to an events calendar through the Community Foundation, because they're neutral ground and they have\n",
            "That's what they do\n",
            "They serve all the nonprofits in the community\n",
            "And we had talked to them\n",
            "But they're maybe 3 or 4 staff, and so that would be a large task to take on trying to coordinate with all the nonprofits\n",
            "And there's many in just this county alone to try to get everybody's events, and that was where we were at, so that we were not competing against each other\n",
            "Because it would make life easier because right now you run into so much competition\n",
            "So the big thing now is nonprofits\n",
            "If they want to do anything in the fall, they have to coordinate with the football schedule in order to make sure that they can get people in attendance\n",
            "But then, once you find a football schedule, you may have 5 or 6 nonprofits who schedule their events, fundraising events on the same exact night\n",
            "And then you still have the same problem, because then it's like you're all pulling from the same people to come to your event\n",
            "If you're gonna tie into reading and literacy because we have had in this county, the percentage has gone down since I've been here\n",
            "I started in 2019, and I think it was about 77% of children that could not read by the time they got to 3rd grade\n",
            "Now we're at 50-something percent, I believe\n",
            "So there has been a drastic change\n",
            "But probably any forms of workshops or training beyond what we are currently doing with New World Reading that help staff be able to specifically our youth development staff work with children, but identify some of the traits that shows that kids cannot read\n",
            "What is it\n",
            "And then the basics of how do you creatively get a child to read without them knowing that they're in a reading exercise\n",
            "Because most kids, if you want to read, it's like, \"I hate reading,\" especially if they can't read\n",
            "And they don't want to do it\n",
            "But how do you make it into a fun activity to teach them the basic necessities that they need of how to identify the words, the syllables, all of that\n",
            "But make it fun\n",
            "So it's almost like they're reading without knowing that they're learning, if that all makes sense\n",
            "Especially if you're gonna look at the demographic for middle school, because that's a complete shutdown because they don't want anyone to know what they can't do\n",
            "It's an embarrassment aspect\n",
            "But if you can make it into a fun activity\n",
            "If that's the workshop on, how do you do this\n",
            "How do you address this\n",
            "How do you teach a child that doesn't have the fundamentals they need to work with them, to encourage them without them just saying, \"I don't want to do this,\" and throwing the book\n",
            "It is a topic that directly impacts what we're doing or we're having an issue with\n",
            "Yeah, it turns into professional development\n",
            "I'm dealing with this problem every day at work, and I'm not quite sure how to maneuver it, navigate it\n",
            "And so that's a workshop that I need\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "And I will also say, mental health has been huge\n",
            "That's been coming across, not only for staff but also for children\n",
            "So you're dealing with a lot of different behavior issues\n",
            "More staff are taking the mental health first aid certification so that they understand what mental health is\n",
            "Specifically, when you got a lot of children who have ADHD, bipolar, and how that ties into their academics and their behaviors\n",
            "So those are some other aspects\n",
            "I will tell you, that has been huge\n",
            "And so I know we've been working on, and a lot of my staff are already trained, have already received the certification\n",
            "We went through it because of what we were seeing every day\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "And when you talk about trauma, trauma-informed care is probably huge because a lot of the children are experiencing trauma\n",
            "If they don't have food at home and they're coming to school hungry, that adds something else\n",
            "And those are part of trauma because they don't know where the next meal is coming from\n",
            "So they may act out or do things because they're hungry\n",
            "Trauma informed care is probably very huge, which a lot of people need to know\n",
            "Staff need to know how to address it, identify it, what to do with it, and how to handle de-escalations if there's a meltdown or something else that takes place\n",
            "I can't necessarily speak to early education, because we're not in a Head Start field\n",
            "But we will refer for those that we know about\n",
            "So if someone contacts us because we don't do it, we know how to refer to those who have high ratings and are not considered just babysitters or day-cares\n",
            "That's more of an early learning aspect\n",
            "We learn about those and we will refer them\n",
            "As for the school district, we operate summer camps in two of the cities here in Alachua County, and we offer during summer our summer program for K through 7th grade\n",
            "So that's basically our relationship with the school district; we run summer camp out of two of our rural communities' elementary schools\n",
            "It's both\n",
            "Because our Y operates more like a community center\n",
            "We will extend invitations to all participants that are in our program\n",
            "But because we are a community center, it's a broader perspective\n",
            "We're trying to bring awareness to an achievement gap in our community, which is literacy\n",
            "So that impacts the entire county and all the communities\n",
            "We bring everybody in\n",
            "We invite those that are in-house, but we invite anyone who wants to come because it's free to them\n",
            "So we need to bring awareness of resources and let them know that they have access to opportunities to help their children that are falling below\n",
            "There has to be more collaboration among the schools and our partnerships among the school district and the community\n",
            "Specifically looking at those who have the children in out-of-school time or have the children in childcare or early learning\n",
            "When you're looking at 0 to 18, who are those entities in the community that are doing the work, and then a partnership with the school district with those entities that have proven impacts, are able to make positive impacts\n",
            "There needs to be a partnership between the school district and those entities to continue the work along with parents\n",
            "Parents have to get more involved as well\n",
            "Not all parents are engaged in what their children are doing more so, than they are\n",
            "And so looking at how do you get more parent engagement in the school district as well as out of school and following the child in the process, the parent volunteering, they have opportunities to help and assist\n",
            "But parent engagement is huge because it's at home\n",
            "If they're not doing it at home, then the teachers can't always force something; you can teach, you can be consistent\n",
            "But then, once they get home, if it's not being done\n",
            "The same thing with out-of-school time, we can try to reinforce what schools are doing, but once they get home, that's a whole different story\n",
            "Everybody has to be able to work together for the benefit of that child\n",
            "The parent\n",
            "Everything starts at home, and so the parent has to be involved with the child early on\n",
            "It starts when they're 1, 2 years old—reading to them, helping them to be able to read and continuing forward in developing that aspect\n",
            "If they see that there are potential questions about a learning disorder or anything like that, catching it early on is key\n",
            "Once they get into school, whether they start in an early learning center and work specifically with the teachers hand in hand or go straight into kindergarten, working hand in hand with the teacher is crucial\n",
            "Everything starts at home from 0 to 5, and then it becomes a partnership with whoever the entity is\n",
            "If they're in early learning childcare, it becomes a partnership with them\n",
            "Once they get into school, it's a partnership throughout the school\n",
            "If they're in out-of-school time programs, it's a partnership with the staff there\n",
            "hey all have to come to the table and recognize that they need each other and begin the conversation\n",
            "No, I mean we're here to do our part by bringing awareness, assisting wherever we can, but we're only one entity\n",
            "But we will partner and collaborate with anyone\n",
            "We love to partner and assist on the journey because there is a true achievement gap in this community\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "My name is Marsha Eubank and I am a member of the Rotary Club of Gainesville\n",
            "And we sponsor a program called Reading Safari, which is done in conjunction with Kelly Costo at county office at SB AC and with Simone went with Jade Salamone and she's the director of the Santa Fe Zoo, the Santa Santa Fe Zoo Kids\n",
            "And rotary has a 5050 raffle every Tuesday and members donate money to the raffle\n",
            "And then 50% of the money goes toward buying the books and the supplies that are needed for the reading safari program, which is done for the kids and for some of the Children in Latch county primary and primary grades\n",
            "And I'm just in charge of the raffle on Tuesdays at lunch\n",
            "I'm not sure\n",
            "I think K through five\n",
            "I'm not sure kindergartners have ever been a part of it, but the Children do receive a book each time they participate\n",
            "And before COVID, there were five trips to the zoo on a bus and they got the book and the lesson and the art project and the treat at that time\n",
            "And af and then during COVID, the zoo keepers, the student zookeeper went to a classroom outside and took the animal with them and did the lesson with the book there\n",
            "And then after COVID, we had trouble getting buses for the five trips to the zoo\n",
            "So they only got to go one time to the zoo at the end\n",
            "And the other four times the zoo keepers went to the classroom OK, to do the lesson there\n",
            "So they still got their books and they got their lessons and they got face to face contact and hands on experiences\n",
            "So that made it good\n",
            "They're chosen by Kelly Kostamo and she works with the schools and they determine which kids would be able to\n",
            "It used to be that Wednesdays were short days\n",
            "So there were Children who were in the after school program at a particular school who could go on Wednesday afternoons for five visits\n",
            "It, it's all different now with, with the bus transportation and no short winds only a short Wednesday every month\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "So we'll see how it all works out this semester\n",
            "Oh, golly, I think I've probably done this for about maybe five type 5 to 8 years\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "Something like that\n",
            "I retired in 2012 and then I started going to Rory\n",
            "I think supplying the books that they get to keep, they get to keep the books\n",
            "I believe\n",
            "Five, five\n",
            "So like almost one per visit, it's one per visit and the lesson that's coordinate with Jade at the zoo, the zoo keepers, then they're recipients of learning how to work with kids because they do the lesson that goes along with the book and the animal of that visit\n",
            "So they, and they work in small groups zoo keepers only have, you know, between five and 10 kids\n",
            "I think the focus is on the reading because I know they're tracking in the, they're tracking in the book, but they're stopping and explaining the concept that they're, that they're focusing on that day\n",
            "I think that it's becoming comfortable\n",
            "I think that working with the Children, especially for the zoo keepers because they're young like you are, they're teenagers and they are not used to working with younger Children\n",
            "So I think the working with them in print in actual print, not on a screen with something that they're holding in their hands\n",
            "So it's tactile and they're seeing something that goes along with it\n",
            "It goes along with the print in terms of the animal or the the surroundings is very you know, they remember more if they're using more of their modalities, both the zoo keepers and the Children and the zoo keepers have already gone through the book before they present the lesson\n",
            "And Jade, the director of the zoo has shown them ways to categorize and, and fit the lesson with, with the print in the book\n",
            "Absolutely\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "So it's a double win for rotary listen\n",
            "But the two ladies who are most responsible for it are Kelly Kostamo and Jade Solomon\n",
            "They need more hands on experiences\n",
            "They need more things that if they can relate to the print, it can't just be screened that needs to be hands on activities that go along with whatever it is that they're reading\n",
            "Yeah, we have a great, I think putting it on, for instance, these pictures could be on the screens we meet at the cave museum\n",
            "So there are big screens up in\n",
            "so it could be more publicized at the meetings but, but I'm right there at the meeting with my display\n",
            "They have to pass by me to get into the meeting and they're all my friends\n",
            "So they, it's generally, every week they, they donate\n",
            "But, I don't know that the other clubs, I don't know that they know about reading safari\n",
            "I don't know if the other clubs do like the, like the dictionary project is statewide\n",
            "That's all, all the rotary clubs participate in their dictionary project\n",
            "And that's for all third graders at all the schools\n",
            "this is much smaller\n",
            "This is this, you know, one class per semester\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "So we only have two classes per year that go through this\n",
            "But it's, you know, it, it gives them like field trips, it gives them hands on\n",
            "They have to use their eyes, they have to use their ears, they have to use their hands, they have to use their noses\n",
            "Which, that was interesting the last time at the zoo because they were, they were touching one of the great, one of the giant turtles, one of the tortoises and it went to the bathroom\n",
            "Oh, yes\n",
            "And they were like, oh, it was so cute\n",
            "And then Ed book that, he's in rotary, he's in a different club than I am\n",
            "But he's the police chief at Santa Fe College and he came when we were going through and all the kids got to see Ed and that was fun\n",
            "It was fun\n",
            "He got to be there when they did that when a turtle did its business\n",
            "Tortoise\n",
            "Not a tor tortoise\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "But we support a lot of learning things in Collateral County and even around the world\n",
            "Oh, no other people help\n",
            "All I have to do is ask, ok, they're there and they help\n",
            "Sure, because I'm not there\n",
            "every single meeting and they always take over it\n",
            "I think everyone is involved in, you know, in, it's not that complicated actually because at the end we, I split the money, whatever I've gotten that day, like Tuesday, it was $42\n",
            "And the lady who checks everyone in, she gives me an envelope with written reading safari, written on it and I write down at the bottom how much is there and put it over and then it's deposited in a special account\n",
            "And then when, then when she get, when Kelly Cosmo has the amount for the books and all she just submits it to rotary and rotary reimburses\n",
            "Anybody can come to a rotary meeting\n",
            "But the rotarians have to join\n",
            "You have to join rotary\n",
            "And that isn't, it isn't\n",
            "you know, you have to pay dues and that sort of thing\n",
            "And, and there are different fees but we, it's a luncheon meeting and there's a breakfast club too\n",
            "But it's, it's mostly business people\n",
            "And, people who are, county people, county commission, county people and doctors\n",
            "And it's a whole lot of people, different, different areas\n",
            "It's community oriented\n",
            "And we have one big, big function every year and it's called the Wild Game Feast\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "And that raises thousands and thousands of dollars\n",
            "And I think it's gone to different pla, it goes to different places each year\n",
            "I think last year it went to Project Youth Build, which is Jonathan Leslie\n",
            "And he, that's a wonderful program that you could look into, but it's for older kids\n",
            "It gives them building and construction, experience\n",
            "And then they have a job, they can get a job\n",
            "So it's preparation for, they get their diplomas, they get their high school diplomas, but they also get trained to do it, do something\n",
            "And then we've done swag the Southwest Advocacy group that, that helps kids in that area for years\n",
            "We did that and sustainable Cambodia is overseas, we support that\n",
            "There are so many things we support the child center for early learning\n",
            "Just through Kelly working on the program, she sets the program up\n",
            "She has to be the one who organizes the transportation and works with Jade with the to, you know, facilitate the tho those kids have to be worked into the program too\n",
            "The zookeeper\n",
            "Yeah, it's complicated and I don't have anything to do with that\n",
            "That's Kelly Kostamo and Jade Salamone\n",
            "we'd have to talk to Kelly to find out how it started because it started before I ever was even in rotary\n",
            "And I'm not sure that the kids at my school were ever involved\n",
            "I think at that time it was mostly kids from the East Side that needed enrichment\n",
            "It's an enrichment activity\n",
            "I think reading safari could be considered enrichment and to give those Children an opportunity to, to do something that they wouldn't normally get to do\n",
            "I don't believe that families come, I think it's just the kids that are involved\n",
            "Now, rotarians are invited when it was at the zoo and it was on Wednesday afternoons at a particular time\n",
            "They knew it was an announcement that you could go and you would have four or five volunteers there\n",
            "That would just be, they'd be, we'll see\n",
            "Now it's different\n",
            "Used to be\n",
            "You, you could volunteer now you have to be signed up in order to be around the Children\n",
            "You have to go through county office to even be around the Children\n",
            "So, it's, but yes, you wouldn't, we would have volunteers that would come to the zoo\n",
            "It was fun\n",
            "Yeah, you would, you would shadow, you would go with a small group so you would shadow one\n",
            "I always went with one group of, one of the zookeeper that I was familiar with\n",
            "But it's just, it's a little different now\n",
            "I think I could still, because I've signed up to be a volunteer\n",
            "So you have to\n",
            "But I could probably go to the school where the, where they were doing it and volunteer in that classroom for that day\n",
            "But it, it's complicated as it should be\n",
            "I mean, with things going on in the schools\n",
            "But yeah, we, we built wilds, we opened whiles in 85\n",
            "The whole concept is it's open\n",
            "Now there's a fence all around it\n",
            "So when I moved from Wiles to Childs Elementary they gave, it was the same floor plan\n",
            "So they gave me the same room\n",
            "So everything just went from one building to the other\n",
            "Now everything is blocked off\n",
            "The only ones we, like on the dictionary project\n",
            "The, the, I think there are four or five rotary clubs in Gainesville\n",
            "They work together\n",
            "But I don't know that we work with other organization of organizations\n",
            "But I think our club is the only one I know our club is the only one that goes reading safari\n",
            "Like when Jonathan Leslie came to speak at the retired educators meeting, I recognized him from speaking at Rotary and he's the director of the Project Youth Build\n",
            "So that's all that\n",
            "The Wild Game Feast is put on by all the rotary clubs of Gainesville\n",
            "And I mean, we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars\n",
            "Yeah, for the, when they get the reason proceeds from that and he's awesome\n",
            "And those kids have just, you know, it's, it's changed lives\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "So, and this is wonderful for a little kid for young kids because they get to do things that aren't, normally, wouldn't be in their purview\n",
            "She's, well, originally we were looking to, increase the, experiences of Children who would not normally get that experience\n",
            "So, it was an enrichment activity and enrichment process for kids who wouldn't normally be able to do the things that we were doing with them at the zoo\n",
            "Primarily on the east side of Gainesville\n",
            "And it was on the Wednesday afternoons when they were in after school care\n",
            "And well, my personal opinion is that we, that kids in general as a whole, spend way too much time on screens and hands on activities in classrooms\n",
            "And at home should be increased, for instance, we spend an incredible amount of time on handwriting and drawing things and we called it see work and the kids then could identify they had to get up and do something to get their supplies and, and there was movement and, and now they're just kind of sitting there on screens and I'd like to see more, more actual engagement with, with the different brutalities\n",
            "So I, I have volunteered in the classrooms at Childs Elementary, but now my principal has gone to a different school, so I haven't volunteered this year because it's a new principle\n",
            "But I think that the, having the actual book in their hands and seeing the animal and touching things and doing an art project that I that in some way is connected with the book that they're gonna take home\n",
            "Yeah, makes it more real\n",
            "It makes it actual\n",
            "Now if they could have something to taste that went along with it, that would be even better, all the senses\n",
            "But when we used to write the units, when you were a little girl and we wrote units, they had to go along with Sunshine State standards\n",
            "That was, they had to go along with that\n",
            "But you needed to include all the modalities and the food was the, the, the tasting was the best part\n",
            "A lot of the kids like the tasting the best\n",
            "What I would think the people who are in charge of education in the, you know, they put up all these tests but the, the freedom to actually teach, it's all, it's very different\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "Absolutely\n",
            "And it all comes down to the teacher being judged by the performance of the students and to some extent that could be true\n",
            "But if you were, if you were a teacher, would you want to work with the Children who were most in need\n",
            "It would be hard\n",
            "So, working with the Children who are most in need, most needy That's we try to do that over this child center for early learning over on my side of town\n",
            "And you know, we've seen good progress with them when they got to go to school\n",
            "When they got in kindergarten, they knew what they needed to know\n",
            "Whereas other kids that didn't have that experience wouldn't\n",
            "But you know, it's all about hands on face to face and I pick up my grandkids now and the first thing they do is get their phones out\n",
            "It could be district leaders, community organizations, they need to have physical contact, physical, they need to actually be holding a book and somebody doing it with them\n",
            "The students, yes, the students need to be actually holding something and working with someone not reading it on a screen, they have to hold the book and look at the pictures and talk about it\n",
            "Discuss it as a group\n",
            "I think the people in the community don't because they don't have a background in education, don't realize the difference between when we actually had kids tracking in the print reading along with us and had classroom sets of books\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "They don't, they don't actually if they think back to when they were in school\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "But it's, it's a lot different now\n",
            "Ok, because they haven't been in to see, they know that if there's a teacher shortage and the people who are in education now\n",
            "Yeah, since, but I think some people think a I is just gonna take over, you won't even need teachers after a while\n",
            "Just tune into your computers and, and, and that, and now they're going to college and you can get your degree online\n",
            "yeah, I took a lot that would take a lot of fun out of it though, wasn't it\n",
            "Just that I, I really enjoy collecting the money for the, for the reading safari at Rotary B because the kid, the people who are investing in it know and understand that these Children are gonna receive something that they wouldn't normally have gotten\n",
            "But in the lesson and in the book that they get to keep and in the experience of doing something that's enriching so that, you know, it's, it's well received in the people who do it every week\n",
            "They don't care\n",
            "A lot of times it's a 5050 raffle\n",
            "So they're supposed to get half the money, but most of them just turn in the other half\n",
            "So it goes to any safari\n",
            "They don't even want the money\n",
            "Oh, that's great\n",
            "But it's fun\n",
            "It's fun\n",
            "My name is Cathy Winfrey\n",
            "I'm the Program Manager of Healthy Families ACUB\n",
            "ACUB stands for Alachua, Columbia, Union, and Bradford\n",
            "Those are the four counties that we serve\n",
            "We have the most participants in Alachua County\n",
            "I've been the Program Manager here for 14 years now\n",
            "So as a Program Manager, we have what we call Family Support Workers who serve the families\n",
            "We have 2 supervisors over the Family Support Workers, and as the Program Manager, I'm over the whole program, including both supervisors\n",
            "In addition to providing supervision to them, Healthy Families is a program under the UF College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and we are a grant-funded program\n",
            "I oversee all the deliverables for our grant, which involves submitting various reports to Tallahassee\n",
            "My job entails not only supervising the team and the supervisors but also submitting deliverables to Healthy Families Florida\n",
            "Additionally, I do outreach in the community, educating different community partners about our services and sometimes tabling at different events where there may be potential participants\n",
            "Yes, we serve prenatal to age 5\n",
            "Participants with children of that age can successfully complete the program by age 3, but if they're high risk and need a lot more support, they can stay until the focus child is 5 years old\n",
            "Not really\n",
            "We utilize an evidence-based curriculum called Growing Great Kids, and they also have Growing Great Families\n",
            "It focuses a lot on the child's developmental milestones as well as parent-child interaction\n",
            "We certainly promote literacy\n",
            "Luckily, I have a resource that allows me to get books\n",
            "Last week, I received a hundred books from the Friends of the Library\n",
            "They donate the books to the library headquarters, and then I pick them up and distribute them\n",
            "These are board books appropriate for children ages 0 to 5, and we distribute them to our families\n",
            "Our curriculum likely has a module on reading to your child, but we don't have a specific literacy curriculum that focuses solely on literacy\n",
            "Just a little bit more background on Healthy Families\n",
            "Our mission is child abuse and neglect prevention\n",
            "We're a home visitation program, so we actually go to the families' homes\n",
            "We provide parent education and support to expecting parents and parents of newborns up through age 5\n",
            "We measure the children's progress developmentally by utilizing the Ages and Stages Questionnaires to ensure the child is developmentally on track\n",
            "That's kind of hard to say because one nice thing about Healthy Families Florida is that they have a very robust training program\n",
            "My staff gets training on everything from child abuse and neglect to domestic violence, working with families with mental health issues, and working with families with substance issues\n",
            "They offer a lot of training, so I can't really think of any additional training that I feel like my staff would need that they're not already getting\n",
            "we provide them the books that we get from the Friends of the Library\n",
            "We always encourage our families\n",
            "Our program focuses heavily on parent-child interaction, so we highly encourage parents to read to their children\n",
            "Yes, I've shared the link with my staff\n",
            "I was already aware of the Dolly Parton initiative, where you can get books, but then I came across the New World's Reading Initiative while looking at the Anita Zucker Center website\n",
            "I shared that link with my staff because it targets different age groups compared to the Dolly Parton initiative\n",
            "For our children that are still at home with their parents, we provide support directly\n",
            "For those that do attend Pre-K or Early Head Start, we sometimes get a release and permission to collaborate with the teachers if necessary\n",
            "We certainly refer parents to the Early Learning Coalition if they need help paying for their child's childcare or education prior to kindergarten\n",
            "Whenever there's an event that the families might be interested in, we try to share that information with them\n",
            "I participate in a lot of meetings, where I often get updates from partners\n",
            "For example, some members of our Healthy Families Advisory Board Committee are from the Early Learning Coalition and HIPPY\n",
            "They share updates with me, such as when they are signing up for VPK, and I, in turn, share that information with my staff, who disseminate it to the families\n",
            "I think definitely by sharing resources like the Dolly Parton and the New World's Reading Initiative is important\n",
            "Another resource is the United Way, which has a Campaign for Grade-Level Reading\n",
            "I'm not on the committee, but I get emails from them\n",
            "I'm not sure of all the good work they are doing regarding reading literacy, but it is important to collaborate and share these resources\n",
            "I'm not sure if we really need to improve that much\n",
            "I think there are communities already doing a good job promoting reading literacy\n",
            "We certainly want to reach as many families as we can\n",
            "The only thing that comes to mind that maybe could be improved is if the two reading programs we talked about that provide free books to children only serve certain targeted zip codes\n",
            "If we could extend these programs to even more zip codes, that would be a way to improve\n",
            "I'm not sure\n",
            "I mean, definitely, we want our community leaders to promote literacy as much as possible\n",
            "But I can't think of a concrete step other than providing books\n",
            "Definitely, I think schools should focus on reading\n",
            "My child is now 22 years old, so I'm a bit out of the loop, but I know that sometimes schools focus a lot on passing standardized tests\n",
            "I wish they had more time to promote reading, where kids could just sit and read\n",
            "I think we're already doing it with programs like the Anita Zucker Center and the Lastinger Center\n",
            "The programs that UF offers are great, and I think it's wonderful that UF has these programs\n",
            "We see kids, I'd probably say from Orlando to the Georgia border that come to us\n",
            "One of the primary reasons we're so popular is because I get funding through Scottish Rite, which allows us to help pay for the services\n",
            "Our clinic is a paid clinic\n",
            "But I use that funding to help pay for the services\n",
            "Getting a comprehensive evaluation, if not through school, which in the schools they don't really do comprehensive evaluations, is very expensive\n",
            "So, we make it affordable\n",
            "I primarily do evaluations, mainly because I also teach\n",
            "In the fall and spring, I don't have the time to do ongoing intervention\n",
            "However, in the summer, like right now, in the month of July, I usually offer a reading intervention program for kids with dyslexia\n",
            "It's run with me and some of our graduate students\n",
            "It's quite intensive—three 90-minute sessions per week for the month of July, totaling 12 sessions\n",
            "We use structured literacy, following Orton-Gillingham principles\n",
            "Well, not really\n",
            "I follow structured literacy and, while Scottish Rite does that, I don't strictly fall under them\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "And that's also very affordable as well\n",
            "What we're able to do is charge based on our department, but even $100 can be out of reach for some people\n",
            "So, while I can provide a lot of services, most are evaluations\n",
            "They take the evaluations, go back to their schools or wherever they are, and try to get the appropriate intervention\n",
            "I make referrals when I can\n",
            "Obviously, I don't know appropriate tutors in every area of the state, but where I can, I try to connect people with services\n",
            "No, this program is just me\n",
            "I get graduate students every semester, so I don't have that option\n",
            "After the evaluations, I go over it and explicitly state what the parents need to do as next steps, and a lot of times they do reach back out to me for support, but other than that, it's just me\n",
            "Yeah, it's just me\n",
            "Well, I don't want to give my age away, but back when I was doing my PhD, we were in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences, previously part of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n",
            "We had a dyslexia clinic that disbanded when we moved out of Liberal Arts\n",
            "I picked it up and have been seeing kids with reading problems since around 2010 at Shands Rehab for Kids at Magnolia Park\n",
            "The formal program started in 2016, but I was the designated person for reading kids from that moment\n",
            "Initially, it was strictly evaluations, but since 2016 we've tried to do both evaluations and interventions\n",
            "Not many\n",
            "Right now we have eight kids because I have two graduate students\n",
            "They are 90-minute sessions, so with a 15-minute break and a lunch break, they can only see four kids a day\n",
            "If I have three graduate students, I can do more, but this summer I only have two\n",
            "My definition of dyslexia is pretty narrow, meaning oral language is good\n",
            "I don't put those kids with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) in that group, right\n",
            "'m looking for at least average listening comprehension, so I have kids with truly reading disabilities\n",
            "Reading is a language-based skill, right\n",
            "Typically, we do pre- and post-assessments\n",
            "Four weeks isn't a long time, but we see improvement\n",
            "My goal is to make sure they don't slide back and maintain, and then improve over the four weeks\n",
            "Half the students haven't received any formal reading tutoring, and we're quite intensive—three 90-minute sessions per week\n",
            "We do see nice gains in that time\n",
            "Some kids come back every summer, and progress is made\n",
            "I think there's a lack of information given to parents\n",
            "Many parents don't know that dyslexia falls under specific learning disability, and they come to me because they want to hear the word dyslexia\n",
            "There's a disconnect\n",
            "From what parents tell me, it seems there's no structured building on skills\n",
            "It appears to be more haphazard, which leads to spinning wheels and not much progress\n",
            "Parents often don't know what their child’s intervention involves, but feedback indicates a lack of strategy instruction for improving reading comprehension\n",
            "I haven't formally studied this, but I see kids falling through the cracks\n",
            "Many times, parents are informed of potential issues by pre-K teachers, but nothing happens after that\n",
            "More education for pre-K teachers on identifying issues and implementing strategies would be beneficial\n",
            "Organizations could do a better job working together, and getting information out there is crucial\n",
            "Early identification and intervention are key, not just identifying and then doing nothing\n",
            "I always say to my families that if they can get the right intervention during the school day, that's ideal\n",
            "If you could take the 90 minutes of reading instruction starting in kindergarten, that's the best scenario\n",
            "I hate to recommend outside private tutors because there's a cost associated with it and for many families, this is not a quick fix\n",
            "Many parents are working full time, so ideally, getting that structured, evidence-based reading instruction in every pre-K and kindergarten classroom is crucial\n",
            "This works for all kids learning to read, not just those with reading problems\n",
            "For those not meeting progress expectations, they need individualized treatment, whether that means training reading specialists or bringing in outside people\n",
            "We need dedicated people to do that\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "No, because I can't diagnose a reading disability that young\n",
            "I'll talk to these parents and say, look out for these things and these are things you can do, but I can't diagnose at that age\n",
            "Preschool teachers noticing kids with speech sound disorders, language disorders, who can't recite nursery rhymes—giving them the education they need to develop these skills can only help\n",
            "If we could have a group of people whose main task was identifying kids at risk for reading disorders and then taking the next step of providing the intervention or at least training the people at that location, be it a preschool, pre-K, kindergarten, whatever, to implement the appropriate instruction\n",
            "I teach a graduate class that isn't specifically for reading, but it covers the main components of language\n",
            "It's not until they are in a semester-long practicum with me that we go over structured literacy in depth\n",
            "They get familiar with the five language components and how they play a part\n",
            "We use the Orton-Gillingham (OG) stages, such as level 1, level 2, and level 3\n",
            "I provide them with literature to read, and I’m there to support them\n",
            "I wish we had more time, but they need to get their hours\n",
            "It’s an amazing learning process\n",
            "You’re always amazed at how quickly they get it right\n",
            "The students I get haven't always worked with kids—they could have been in a hospital placement or whatever—but I always tell them at the beginning that this is going to be very structured\n",
            "You are not going to be picking things out of the air\n",
            "You are going to know why you're targeting this skill at this time, and we're just going to go through it\n",
            "For me, because I'm probably OCD, I love that because I can check off, \"He knows this\n",
            "\" For them, that's the biggest difference\n",
            "But they see it works\n",
            "Like right now, we have a kid who's going to repeat kindergarten\n",
            "We are struggling; we've been working for two weeks on just identifying letters of the alphabet\n",
            "He is so low\n",
            "But the student is like, \"Can we go on\n",
            "\" No, we cannot go on\n",
            "We need to communicate with the mom\n",
            "We can't jump ahead because he's going to fail\n",
            "We have to work slowly, figure out how to get this information, and move on\n",
            "It's different from working in hospitals with adults or in other environments\n",
            "I love instilling that in them: this is what works\n",
            "Yeah, yeah\n",
            "This is a funny thing\n",
            "I have a good friend who's a teacher in Pennsylvania\n",
            "She's not a reading specialist; she's an elementary school teacher\n",
            "She'll ask me here and there for suggestions for a struggling reader\n",
            "About a month ago, she texted me, \"Laurie, the latest thing in reading is this structured literacy\n",
            "\" And I'm thinking, \"Are you kidding me\n",
            "That's not the latest thing\n",
            "And she was like, \"No, no, it just came out\n",
            "My administrator just told me about it,\" and I’m thinking\n",
            "I told her, remember that book I referred to you\n",
            "That’s structured literacy\n",
            "Like, this isn't new\n",
            "I hate to say, but I honestly don’t have any specific recommendations\n",
            "UFly, for the majority of reading instruction, is used for remediation, and I think that manual is amazing\n",
            "I wish more school-based speech pathologists were aware of it and used it\n",
            "That's the way it is here too\n",
            "But I did a workshop for a school board in North Dakota, and they were using the YouFly program in their schools for speech-language pathologists\n",
            "They were actually seeing kids with reading disabilities\n",
            "Here, for the most part, we just do oral language in schools\n",
            "I feel like everyone who can help these kids should be helping them—reading specialists, classroom teachers, and speech pathologists working together\n",
            "I know funding and other factors complicate this, but we need to focus on meeting the kids' needs and ensuring they can read\n",
            "We’re wasting a lot of resources otherwise\n",
            "There have been two survey studies recently\n",
            "Many speech-language pathologists don't feel comfortable working with written language\n",
            "That's a shortcoming of our training programs\n",
            "They don’t see the connection that it's language\n",
            "We need to do a better job addressing that and providing the necessary education to treat these kids confidently and effectively, using evidence-based practices\n",
            "Oh my gosh, I shouldn’t say this, but I read a report from a speech pathology teaching clinic, and the recommendations included using a dyslexia font and colored lenses, rather than teaching reading\n",
            "Of course, I made a big deal about this to my students\n",
            "Would you ever write these recommendations\n",
            "A lot of it is unethical\n",
            "You probably see these reports with all those brain game places\n",
            "If you want to teach your kid to read, they have to read during intervention, not do puzzles\n",
            "Like working memory improvement stuff—the literature is super clear on that\n",
            "You don't improve; you improve on the games,\n",
            "No, I don't\n",
            "But definitely reach out to me if there's anything I can do to help\n",
            "I'd be happy to engage in anything that helps these kids in the county, North Central Florida, wherever you're working\n",
            "I’m always up for collaboration\n",
            "my name is Janalyn Peppel\n",
            "I am the Executive Director of New Technology, Made Simple Now, Inc\n",
            "But we go by New Tech Now\n",
            "So through the Children's Trust and other organizations, our official name is the long version, but we go by New Tech Now\n",
            "We do technology workshops, classes, seminars, events\n",
            "The majority of our audience is K through 12\n",
            "So we primarily teach how to use technology, ways that you can incorporate technology into your career, showing kids how to use a computer, a mouse\n",
            "But also, really more than that, is how to do graphic design, how to do 3D printing, 3D design, coding, and robotics\n",
            "And then we've introduced storytelling and brought in Mr\n",
            "Dominic\n",
            "He can give you his background, but primarily because we wanted to include this storytelling aspect\n",
            "Whether, on my side, I'm more of a visual storyteller, and he is more of a literary\n",
            "So we wanted to kind of infuse that into our program rather than just, you know, showing how you can use technology but really, how you can use it to tell stories and kind of just opens up a lot more opportunities\n",
            "So just to make it really clear, our focus is technology\n",
            "But we do bring in this literacy component\n",
            "And so as we build our organization, that's kind of where we're at at this phase\n",
            "We began in 2016, so we’re not, you know, a long history with this environment of teaching technology in the educational space, but we're not brand new\n",
            "And we have had funding, so we feel like we're in a growth phase right now\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "Well, because, you know, we're in a lot of different meetings\n",
            "We were part of the children's trust\n",
            "We're also part of United Way; they have the campaign for grade level reading\n",
            "And so we worked with Reading Pals and actually partnered with them\n",
            "That kind of started us thinking that we needed to include a lot more literacy into our program\n",
            "We would provide the technology, and then they were bringing some of the activities that were more focused on reading and literacy\n",
            "Then we brought Mr\n",
            "Dominic in and felt like we could expand on what we'd kind of learned from working with United Way and with his experience, just coming up with different research on where we could find ways to enhance all of our programming\n",
            "Like I said, we're growing, and so we started out with basics\n",
            "But we just wanted to create a more robust program where we were kind of hitting a lot more targets at the same time\n",
            "Particularly since we go into programs that are lower income, or rural, or maybe not getting as much exposure and access to technology\n",
            "We just felt like we're bringing the technology\n",
            "But why not work on these issues that a lot of people in our area—which it’s become very evident, especially when we go into classrooms—really lack attention\n",
            "And so we just feel like we're trying to help as much as we can while we're there\n",
            "Well, I probably should give you a little bit of background first\n",
            "I have a Master's of Fine Arts from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop\n",
            "That was my first master's, my second master's from the University of Maine is a Master of Science in education\n",
            "It's a research degree\n",
            "I would not have been able to do any higher education if, in fact, the storytelling component of my life, and where I came up—I'm a second-generation Spanish, Basque and Irish on both sides\n",
            "Second generation, and storytelling was basically what I was surrounded with\n",
            "I also came from a fairly restricted background financially\n",
            "One of the stories that I often tell is how the first pencils I had to write for school were these little stub pencils that my father had left over from business\n",
            "So writing things out was not the first level of storytelling I learned, but it was my storytelling and reading that selected me to go on to higher education\n",
            "I really wasn't gonna go, but I was actually kind of corralled into going\n",
            "That passion is what I try to bring to my students and people I mentor, trying to get them to understand that once you understand story structure, literacy, reading, and researching is the next natural place you go\n",
            "I've been with New Tech Now for about, I'd say, 2 and a half years\n",
            "I was brought in as a consultant to research and design some programs that would fit into their technology pieces, which I did\n",
            "And I've been trying to use those\n",
            "It's a really nice combination for me because I can see, and we can soften, and see—believe in the classroom\n",
            "When the students start to be moved from one area of learning to another, they can move from the technologies which can be very distracting at times, and then the storytelling can kind of ground them\n",
            "We go back and forth\n",
            "So it's been a very positive experience for me\n",
            "Okay, yeah, that's a great question\n",
            "Cause so we're considered an enrichment program\n",
            "And we're completely mobile\n",
            "So we do not have a brick-and-mortar location\n",
            "We only serve other organizations\n",
            "We go to after-school programs, we go into classrooms and work with teachers during school time, we go to community centers and gather students and families, and everyone works together\n",
            "We also work with churches and homeschool groups at libraries\n",
            "No, we were new getting into this space\n",
            "I assumed that people would be happy to have you come into their organization and bring all kinds of learning elements\n",
            "But we found that that's not always the case\n",
            "Some of these programs are pretty active; they have a busy schedule\n",
            "It was very difficult to actually get into school classrooms\n",
            "We thought we would have the most impact there\n",
            "But, as you know, classrooms are very structured\n",
            "They have testing, they have their schedules\n",
            "So it was very difficult for us to get into classrooms, and so we shifted to after-school programs\n",
            "A lot of the larger programs that are in the city of Gainesville are pretty busy\n",
            "They have lots of resources\n",
            "But we found that going outside into the rural areas like Waldo, Archer, Hawthorne, High Springs, and Alachua, they have fewer resources\n",
            "It was actually an easier fit because they had more time available\n",
            "They needed the resources probably more and were just more open to working around a schedule that fit all of us, whereas it was a little more structured with some of the bigger organizations\n",
            "I mean, I feel like we have been successful with the combination\n",
            "Like Dan said, we have the technology, which is what young people want and what they can relate to, but then we also have this hands-on component where we actually give them little notebooks, and there's nothing on the notebook\n",
            "It's a cover and blank pages\n",
            "It doesn't even have lines\n",
            "So we give them these notebooks, and we say these are for you\n",
            "If you want to draw a story, if you want to write a story, if you want to illustrate a story, this is for you to express how you communicate\n",
            "That has been a good indication, so that we can kind of meet them where they are\n",
            "They don't have to feel uncomfortable about how their friend next to them is doing it one way, and they need to do it in another specific way\n",
            "We've found that most organizations that we visit do not have technology; they can't afford it\n",
            "That's why New Tech Now was created\n",
            "We wanted to give organizations the ability to have access to this equipment, give kids access\n",
            "We've had many organizations tell us they want us to bring the equipment and teach kids just basic things like how to log into a program and use a password\n",
            "To us, it seemed very basic like they should already know this\n",
            "But, most of the time that we spend is getting everyone logged into a device so that we can get started with our program\n",
            "We've built workarounds for that\n",
            "I think being able to allow them to use this equipment to learn how to create, rather than just be consumers, has been effective\n",
            "Giving them that hands-on element as well enhances the experience, because they need both skills\n",
            "I think, for me and Dan, we're of a different generation, but we're seeing that kids still need that hands-on element\n",
            "To engage them in what we're doing, we provide that technology piece, which gets them more excited and ready to participate\n",
            "That's just my take on it\n",
            "No\n",
            "And and we I we always ask how many of you have computers at home, and they'll almost all raise their hands\n",
            "Then we'll say, \"What are we talking about\n",
            "\" and it almost always comes back down to a smartphone\n",
            "It's a lot different when you're actually in the trenches doing the work\n",
            "For example, one of the things that I started with was saying to them, what do you read at home\n",
            "Do\n",
            "Do you read\n",
            "What are you looking at\n",
            "What do you read, what are you interested in\n",
            "And if they would access that information and bring it forward, then when I tried to get them to create in the book, make up something\n",
            "It would almost always just be that they thought they were trying to please me by repeating what they had said they were reading or learning\n",
            "So I don't do that now until we're in the middle of the creative process\n",
            "Then I say, what are you learning at home\n",
            "What are you reading at home\n",
            "And it's very bleak\n",
            "But again, that was my background, too\n",
            "The parents in that environment are often very focused on survival and getting food on the table, and they're not going to bring the World Book Encyclopedia into their home, you know\n",
            "But anyway, the point is that there's been a lot of adjusting in the program\n",
            "Janalyn does a thing on presenting using Canva\n",
            "How do you present your idea\n",
            "And I do the thing like, well, what's the idea\n",
            "These skills that we're teaching, including if the students are ready for it, we'll do a presentation where we have a microphone and a little speaker thing, and they present\n",
            "These are all skills they're going to absolutely need as they go up in school, and it's very barren where they're learning those skills where they are now\n",
            "It looks like almost everything is just about discipline and not a lot of creativity, except for an occasional teacher that we run into, which is mind-blowing when we see it\n",
            "To summarize, it's a lot of adjusting on the fly to the students that we're working with, having 4 or 5 units of literacy integrated into Janalyn's sessions\n",
            "They're so excited to see what she offers, and I'm in the background waiting for that chance when I see that they've settled down\n",
            "We can then try something within the books\n",
            "So that's a great question, too\n",
            "So originally, when we began writing grants, my experience was when I was bringing in the technology, it took—well, you needed at least 4 hours to work with them and for them to kind of get whatever it was we were working on\n",
            "So that was my vision\n",
            "But that is not how the system works\n",
            "We take what we get\n",
            "I'll just give you some examples\n",
            "We work with Caring and Sharing Learning Center on the east side of town\n",
            "We have a teacher there, and she loves for us to come in\n",
            "If we had enough funding and everything worked out, she would probably have us come once or twice a week to do activities because she knows we have the equipment\n",
            "She doesn't know all of the software that I know, but she does know how to teach\n",
            "She's a wonderful, creative teacher, and we love working with her\n",
            "In the past, we've gone 4 or 5 weeks in a row a couple of times a week, and then we took a long break, and then we might have come back a couple of times 6 months later\n",
            "So it was the same children, but I've gone to her classroom for multiple years\n",
            "She teaches second grade, so they're not the same kids, but we have kind of a good working relationship\n",
            "Some of those kids I then see in the after-school program a couple of years later\n",
            "So I've worked with those children throughout their life\n",
            "We have other organizations where we might work with them for 2 hours, and that's all we will ever see of those children\n",
            "For example, I went out to Melrose and worked at a church\n",
            "Some of the kids that came to the church might live in a different county, so I may never see that child again\n",
            "We also work with Girls Place\n",
            "Girls Place is similar to Caring and Sharing\n",
            "I've been going to see them for years\n",
            "We started out with the second grade and did a program for about 4 hours generally\n",
            "It's a little bit of an exception if we go over the 4 hours, but there are other activities for them to do\n",
            "Those second graders, I came back a couple of years later, and they sent me to the fourth grade\n",
            "It was the same kids\n",
            "They said, \"I remember you\n",
            "I still have my little thing we made\n",
            "\" You do notice that you get a lot more buy-in from the kids when they have seen us multiple times\n",
            "There's a trust built\n",
            "At A\n",
            "Quinn Jones school, which is an alternative school, the kids had serious trust issues initially, but the more we were there, the more comfortable they got with us\n",
            "So like I said when we first began, I felt like 4 hours of technology—I’m talking about the technology piece here\n",
            "Now, we're not promising that in 4 hours you're going to be reading above the third-grade level\n",
            "We want to engage you in literacy, make you feel more comfortable with reading, expressing yourself in storytelling, or understanding story form\n",
            "For our program in 4 hours, say our goal is to teach you how to do 3D printing\n",
            "Underlying that, my goal is that you understand 3D design\n",
            "Now, you're probably not going to sit down and want to do something on a computer and learn 3D design unless you have some tangible outcome\n",
            "I feel that any sort of design is important and a valuable skill\n",
            "In 4 hours, I can teach you how to 3D print something, and I can prove that we can accomplish that goal\n",
            "We've also introduced graphic design\n",
            "At the end of a 2, 3, 4-hour block, I want to make sure that you have been able to accomplish the assignment we give\n",
            "We pretty much meet those goals\n",
            "Not for our goals, not for our nonprofit's goals\n",
            "Now, Dan, you might want to introduce\n",
            "Well, one of the things that I have underneath everything I'm doing is to recognize story structure\n",
            "This comes from stuff that I've worked with from all ages\n",
            "I worked at Paramount Pictures for 11 years in story rooms\n",
            "I'm trying to get a group of a subgroup of the students to work almost like a story team\n",
            "Asking questions like, okay, so what should happen next\n",
            "What's the conflict\n",
            "Where's your lead character\n",
            "What happens in the middle of the story\n",
            "And then what happens at the end\n",
            "From this comes a very important literary skill, which is how to tell when someone is telling you a story and not necessarily telling you the truth\n",
            "That is really so important right now\n",
            "We try to touch on that subject and introduce it into the conversation, especially with our older students\n",
            "Some get it right away—they recognize when it's a story and understand the questions to ask if they are really looking for information\n",
            "Yes, because in other programs that take middle school to high school to college students and mentor them through their writing skills and nonfiction skills, that's exactly what happens\n",
            "You can't do one without the other\n",
            "You can't put a fictional character and make that character work without understanding that someone's going to ask, why are they doing that\n",
            "What are they basing their decisions on\n",
            "How are they seeing the world\n",
            "Those are all nonfiction skills, those are essay skills\n",
            "The storytelling aspect is profoundly important and almost invisible in our lives\n",
            "We do it all the time, but we don't always recognize it\n",
            "Well, as Janalyn has described, we are enrichment\n",
            "So we're in there really in the trenches, reacting to the nature of the group of students that we're working with\n",
            "We try very hard to look at the books and work with the books\n",
            "Sometimes we even do a program where we keep the books and then return them to the students, so we’re actually looking at their work—not grading it, but looking at it\n",
            "This gives us an idea of who has special needs and how we can address those\n",
            "Janalyn and I work closely together on this and will quickly identify which students need special attention\n",
            "We have to adapt for these students\n",
            "There’s a lot of adaptation\n",
            "Right now, it's just the two of us\n",
            "There have been times when we've been lucky enough to have some really talented people with us\n",
            "One of them moved away for another opportunity\n",
            "It’s very adaptive\n",
            "We have these units that we know deliver and that we know result in the students having something in their hands, whether they've written a story in a book, drawn a story, or used stickers to tell a story\n",
            "If they're more advanced, they might tell the story\n",
            "We give them little prizes for telling the story\n",
            "Janalyn does a lot of work on graphic design\n",
            "Did they design their little poster\n",
            "Did they take it home and show it to their parents\n",
            "We’re also trying to involve the audience, parents, and other students in the presentation and performance\n",
            "So it’s a big question, but I hope that answers it\n",
            "The tool I'm using is based on 4 or 5 different university studies on story circle structure\n",
            "I actually have a PDF I could show you if you want\n",
            "It's real easy that we would use to show volunteers or whomever\n",
            "Universities like the University of California have studies that show how storytelling and background information, which Janalyn is providing, lead to increased literacy\n",
            "So we're using known and proven effective methods\n",
            "We do not have a formal curriculum; we have units that we work from that we’ve designed because we know they’re very adaptable\n",
            "If we had purchased a curriculum, it wouldn’t work for what we’re doing\n",
            "We don't have the students long enough\n",
            "We’re more of a performative presentation involving an adaptive teaching unit, so we wouldn’t be able to use a long-term curriculum\n",
            "Yes, for the technology component, yes, we completely evaluate that because that is part of how our grants are written—that we will evaluate if the student learned how to design in 3D or learned how to code at a basic level\n",
            "So yes, we do evaluate that\n",
            "As far as the literacy component, like I said in the beginning, that was something we were bringing in as a bonus to our technology program\n",
            "We are not considered a literacy program; we’re considered a technology program\n",
            "So, like Dan says, we’re kind of evaluating off of our personal backgrounds, what we've seen when we're in classrooms, what we know teachers are using as evaluation tools\n",
            "Before we began this program, I was part of the United Way's Grade Level Campaign and other literacy initiatives\n",
            "I actually asked, considering the community's literacy expertise, what tools we could use to start evaluating this component\n",
            "But I got no answers, no responses that provided any concrete evaluation tools\n",
            "So that's why we’re using our best judgment and what we know works in other areas\n",
            "We are a technology program, and as far as evaluating, we are doing what we can\n",
            "So let me explain why I haven't reached for some other simplified multiple-choice assessment tool\n",
            "In one class, we may have students who vary widely in age and abilities, including those with special needs\n",
            "I wouldn't be able to measure that progress in an hour and a half, 2-hour program that we do twice in 2 months\n",
            "What we can do is show them how they can continue what they’re learning, where they are in their learning, and encourage them to pay attention\n",
            "If a student says they’re really into Spider-Man, I ask them to explain the story structure of Spider-Man\n",
            "We use that interest to give them something to take back\n",
            "So, in many ways, we are an introductory program, enhancing student interest, developing student interest, and working towards some personal goal that the student may have\n",
            "I mean, I don't know that it's necessary for our program\n",
            "I think, for our community, it would be helpful, as far as you as a researcher, if we’re asking several questions before we leave\n",
            "Adding in one or two more, I’m not sure\n",
            "Is it a question we ask, or is it something we observe and report back\n",
            "Do we say, “Oh, by the way, we were in a classroom of 3rd graders, and we observed that probably 3 of them really needed some serious help”\n",
            "But then, what do we do with that information\n",
            "If there was some sort of tool that everyone in our community doing literacy programs could use, that would be wonderful\n",
            "But I don’t know if that's even possible\n",
            "Well, you know, as I mentioned before, my education degree is a research degree, and the number one rule about research is, you need to have stability\n",
            "You need to have a control and some idea of what you're measuring against\n",
            "That would be a place for schools that have regular students to create that environment and experiment with teaching to a test or not teaching to the test\n",
            "In the kind of trenches we’re in, so much depends on flexibility, adaptability, and trusting that our tools and the results we get are showing progress from when we begin working with the students to where we end\n",
            "Whether that progress can actually be considered research-based, I would have some doubts about achieving that with the way we’re working with students as an enrichment program at this time\n",
            "That would be my casual observation\n",
            "Yes\n",
            "Yes, most everything that we base it on is something tangible we can look at and see that they created it\n",
            "For example, in one of our after-school programs, in one of the city centers, there was an art show after the program was done\n",
            "The parents came, there was a pizza party, and the students' work was on the wall\n",
            "That’s the kind of feedback and results we’re looking for\n",
            "No, not that I'm aware of\n",
            "I think it would be important for people to understand that kids do not know everything there is to know about technology\n",
            "They absolutely do not\n",
            "They know how to unlock a phone and play games on a phone, and they know how to change the settings of a phone\n",
            "But when it comes to actual knowledge of technology, they really do not have that\n",
            "I’ve noticed it with second or third graders all the way up to middle and high scholars\n",
            "It’s a huge misconception that we are constantly battling\n",
            "People automatically assume, well, we don’t want to give kids more technology because they already have too much\n",
            "But when I sit with a fifth or sixth grader and they don’t know how to open a computer, log in, and use software, that’s a major issue\n",
            "My biggest moment of realization came when I had a little boy who couldn’t read\n",
            "I was reading to him, and he asked if he could play a game on the computer if he finished his books\n",
            "When he went to the computer, he couldn’t log in because he couldn’t read or type\n",
            "He used the voice recognition feature to proceed\n",
            "That was a huge red flag for me\n",
            "He couldn’t type or read the prompts on the computer\n",
            "He needed my help to log in\n",
            "Then, when he needed to find what he wanted, he used the voice command to navigate\n",
            "This underlined the severity of the issue—kids have limited actual technology skills beyond basic phone usage, and that severely impacts their literacy and overall educational experience\n",
            "If more teachers would teach storytelling and knew how to teach storytelling, both orally and in writing, and knew how to explore the story using science, more kids would have critical thinking skills\n",
            "They would not be swayed by somebody standing in front of them, telling them a story that is not to their benefit\n",
            "And that is my personal stance and what I really, really care about\n",
            "They need to passionately understand that the same things they care about, students are not able to care about yet because they don't understand what they're looking at or what they're hearing\n",
            "They don't know they're being manipulated\n",
            "So if we can, you know, if the organization is open to it, we love having those types of events where the whole family is involved\n",
            "We want the kids to be able to showcase what they've done\n",
            "Other ways we've done it include creating information for them to take home so they can continue the activity\n",
            "I've geared it toward hoping that the parent might see this or the child might ask the parent for help\n",
            "For example, they might say, \"I need to get on the computer to do this program I learned at school,\" and the parents will help them\n",
            "We're trying to get that information home and start a dialogue between the child and the parents\n",
            "The books are another way to involve parents, hoping they will share the stories or activities at home\n",
            "I'd like to add to that\n",
            "When I go through the books with each student, I ask them if they want to show this to their parent or someone they like\n",
            "It's a fraught question because sometimes they say, \"I'm not showing this to anybody,\" or \"I have nobody to show this to,\" or \"I don't know where I would show this\n",
            "The great thing about the art show is that it started with students showing each other\n",
            "They were willing to put it up on the wall, then we had a pizza party, and then we invited others\n",
            "Many students come from difficult home lives, and that needs to be considered when planning how to involve families and address their engagement\n",
            "I think a lot of that comes down to the kids\n",
            "Our main goal is we want them to have fun\n",
            "It's an after-school program; they've worked all day at school, they've been told what to do and how to do it all day long\n",
            "So we're there to have fun in an educational way\n",
            "The relationships we've built and have had for years are with organizations that know they can trust us\n",
            "They know the kids are going to learn something valuable; we’re not wasting their time or the organization's time\n",
            "The kids' feedback is our biggest goal—we really want to make sure they have a good time because they’re our main customers\n",
            "If they’re not having a positive experience, they will tell someone, and someone is going to tell us we don't need to come back\n",
            "Luckily, we haven't had that happen\n",
            "We just want to make sure the kids have a positive experience when we're with them, and that everyone involved in the process has a positive experience\n",
            "We were giving them sheets, and we wanted them to fill out the sheet in the beginning before we started the program, and then at the very end to get their feedback\n",
            "But they couldn’t read our sheets—every one of them was saying, \"I don't know what this question is\n",
            "\" So we turned to reading it to them and getting a show of hands\n",
            "I mean, that's a big question\n",
            "There are so many answers for that\n",
            "I know the libraries are doing a lot of work with literacy and programs\n",
            "I think it just takes everyone’s input, everyone realizing\n",
            "Well, actually, I’m going to say, I think it needs to that there needs to be awareness of the problem\n",
            "I don't know that everyone in this community realizes the severity of the problem\n",
            "I also work at the newspaper, and I've mentioned to our publisher that there’s a huge literacy problem with kids\n",
            "He didn't know that; he's not from Gainesville\n",
            "They started doing some research and wanted to start doing interviews, but so far nothing has come from that\n",
            "I just really don't think people understand the problem\n",
            "Education about the issue is needed\n",
            "We work with a lot of after-school providers dealing with juvenile issues, and not being able to read leads to not being able to find a job, getting into the prison system—all these issues\n",
            "I just don’t think people understand the long-term effects or they don’t want to\n",
            "That’s my opinion\n",
            "I have something\n",
            "This is a little personal thing that actually comes from my working with high school students and college students\n",
            "What I would like to see—this is a bit of a fantasy, but I think it would be tremendous—is that as soon as students started to show talent in literacy in the middle schools and high schools, there would be a citywide program that encouraged them to teach others and bring that forward, and we would reward them\n",
            "Some of the students I worked with under Janalyn would be filling out 2-3 pages in their story, and when I asked them to share, they would cover it because they didn’t want other kids to see that they could write so much when others couldn’t even read\n",
            "If you could lift those students up as examples and bring others with them, teaching them story structure, short story writing, poetry, and lyrics—which many kids are interested in—that could be highly beneficial\n",
            "Performance often serves as the basis for many people to deepen literacy, stemming from storytelling\n",
            "My fantasy is a citywide program, perhaps based in rec centers or libraries, that would pull these students in as part of their normal routine\n",
            "I’m not talking about special exclusive programs, but something based on writing and literacy\n",
            "Absolutely\n",
            "You know, we have those in athletics, right\n",
            "We do\n",
            "We have those in athletics, and we have those in private organizations that feed into athletics like the American Legion Baseball League\n",
            "It exists in athletics, but it doesn't exist in literacy\n",
            "It's crazy\n",
            "I mean, I feel like we're just a piece of the puzzle\n",
            "We're just trying to contribute as much as we can and do our part as citizens of the community\n",
            "We're going to continue to be a technology program and continue to, with Dan's help, increase our literacy program\n",
            "It’s something very near and dear to his heart\n",
            "I think we’ve kind of covered it\n",
            "We did fill out the survey, so you should have that\n",
            "I mean, it’s probably a good idea that we should have a little more feedback from them\n",
            "Part of our funding from the Children's Trust involves them following up with some of the organizations to get feedback about the program\n",
            "Other than the organizations telling us they love the program and asking when we can come back, it’s always been positive\n",
            "There have been students along the way that we have touched who may not have had much exposure to literacy due to Dan's background in filmmaking\n",
            "He tells them stories about when he was writing films, and they become more engaged\n",
            "They might not connect that a movie was written by someone\n",
            "They’ve come up to him afterwards, asking more in-depth questions than what they would ask an English teacher\n",
            "It would be helpful to get more input from the organizations themselves to see how we’re impacting their students and what we could do to increase that impact\n",
            "Back on my work at the newspaper, I feel like people are not understanding that there’s this issue\n",
            "When I brought it up to the publisher, he thought it was something we should report on\n",
            "Now, we don’t have enough reporters and time to focus on it\n",
            "But if that’s something you think would help the issue, we have a large readership\n",
            "If there was someone that could report on it, a story or an ongoing feature that focused on this, it would help generate awareness\n",
            "And what I found, as we work in rural areas and with kids that are low-income, is that we all know the problem because we see it every day\n",
            "But people in more affluent communities don’t see it\n",
            "Those people need to understand\n",
            "It might not affect your household, but it will at some point because it’s going to be someone without an education affecting you\n",
            "There needs to be awareness that it will affect everyone\n",
            "And how about being able to describe a character's behaviors and what they mean, and the results by the middle part of the story\n",
            "Imagine if you're able to do that with people around you, noticing behaviors because you're paying attention\n",
            "You're not being encouraged to understand behavior\n",
            "This is so needed at the middle school level\n",
            "There's so much talent out there being laid waste because the mean is so low that when somebody starts to rise, they get pulled back into the mean\n",
            "Yet, if you could raise them, it would encourage and inspire others\n",

            "You know what the students in the ESOL program are doing would be different from the adult Ed GED program and depending on students' levels, what we're working on with them would change\n",
            "But just a broad idea\n",
            "In our ESOL program we use the Ventures textbook series\n",
            "And then we also supplement it with Burlington English\n",

            "No, not Ed to Go\n",
            "I'll have to get that other name, but it's another workplace educational program that students can access either as part of a lesson in class or outside of class for extra work\n",

            "We use the Steck-Vaughn GED materials for the higher level students\n",

            "We also use Townsend Press for some of our English or language arts classes\n",
            "Additionally, we're looking at Aztec Learning to supplement as well\n",

            "To get started in our program, they either call, come in, or email\n",
            "Based on that contact, we have them complete the online application for Santa Fe College\n",
            "Depending on the student, they can either come in and get help doing that or do it on their own\n",
            "Our ESOL program has students do the application with advisors to help them complete it\n",
            "Once they complete the application, depending on the program, the adult GED program has students do an online orientation\n",
            "If students prefer to come in and get assistance with the orientation, they can do so, and an advisor will help them\n",
            "The ESOL program is more hands-on; students come in, work with advisors, discuss the program, and set goals\n",
            "Both programs have students take a placement test\n",
            "ESOL students take a CASAS test, and adult GED students take a TABE test\n",

            "We have a variety of levels and classes for students depending on the campus\n",
            "Sometimes we have a one-room schoolhouse where everyone is together, and other times we have an individualized learning lab where students can come in and get assistance at their level\n",

            "It's $30 a semester\n",
            "The state just put that requirement in place, I think, so students would feel like they are participating in their education\n",
            "It may be a little more investment\n",
            "But we also do have safety nets in place\n",
            "If that's absolutely not possible for students, we have donation accounts and agencies that will help students pay their fee\n",
            "Yeah\n",
            "So this year, I think we're looking at about 800 students and all of our campuses\n",
            "You know, in a semester, a guesstimate would be about 300-350 students again, divided into different sites, and morning, afternoon or evening\n",
            "And our ESOL program is exploding right now\n",
            "We have more students applying to the program than we have seats\n",
            "And so we're trying to build capacity\n",
            "But you know, we it\n",
            "It goes with how many staff you have, what space you have for students, and just how many students you can bring in and test and assimilate at a time to find spaces for everybody\n",
            "We see a variety of students, but primarily Hispanic students\n",
            "Yeah, we have some instructors who create their own lessons and enjoy the freedom to do what they feel is best for their students\n",
            "However, we have state curriculum frameworks for our different courses that we make sure all instructors have access to\n",
            "Our ESOL program follows a common curriculum with the Venture series, which is a leveled series, so students use familiar textbooks as they progress to the next level\n",
            "The same goes for our adult education classes; we have similar materials that we use even if we supplement with other resources\n",
            "We provide training for instructors, either by bringing trainers to our site or by sending staff to conferences\n",
            "There are a couple of adult education professional development groups in the state, such as IPAE (Institute for Adult Education for Professional Development), the Florida Literacy Coalition, and ACE of Florida (Adult and Continuing Education)\n",
            "These entities put on conferences, offer trainings, and provide online training opportunities\n",
            "All of our staff are given this information and encouraged to participate in professional development activities\n",
            "A push by the State is integrated education and training (IET) programs\n",
            "This incorporates workplace readiness and career preparation into courses, contextualized learning\n",
            "The goal is to have our adult education students participate in a career and technical program while getting support from our program\n",
            "Instructors always appreciate more information on how to integrate workplace readiness and contextualized curriculum activities into their classes\n",
            "They also want more information on how to improve their teaching in specific subjects, whether it's reading for the GED, writing the essay for the GED, or math\n",
            "Additionally, instructors ask for assistance in working with students with various disabilities, supporting them in the classroom, and varying instruction to make it accessible at all levels\n",
            "No, we have students with disabilities in our classes\n",
            "If we have academically leveled classes, sometimes students with disabilities might fall into the more beginning academic levels\n",
            "However, this can also include students without disabilities who are at those levels\n",
            "For our workplace preparation classes, we prepare students to enter programs like the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) program\n",
            "We offer contextualized classes to help them prepare, CPR and First Aid training with certified instructors, direct care classes, and CNA preparation classes\n",
            "Students with disabilities can participate in all of these classes to the extent that they are able\n",
            "Well, we evaluate their test scores\n",
            "We evaluate how many students hang around long enough to retest; because you can imagine that retention is always a challenge\n",
            "Retention is another professional development activity that's often requested because that's sometimes difficult with adult education students\n",
            "And also we measure how many of our students are transitioning into work or transitioning into further educational classes, whether it be while they're in our program or after they leave our program\n",
            "So of course, we always want to improve that\n",
            "How many improve on tests when they take their tests, and how many transition\n",
            "How many earn their GEDs, all of that\n",
            "Time\n",
            "It's just staffing and time\n",
            "If we had more staff to assist with the various duties of our program and more time to do a really great job at everything, it would help\n",
            "If you're spread too thin, you're not doing the best you could in every responsibility\n",
            "Personally, that's what I think\n",
            "For our program overall, I think we need to pay our staff more\n",
            "We have a basic level pay for our part-time and even our full-time staff, which makes it hard to hire and retain quality individuals\n",
            "We've got some wonderful people working with us now, and I worry they can't stay forever at this rate of pay; we might lose them\n",
            "We get a lot of part-time people coming in who then get a full-time job and leave\n",
            "So, for the program, it would be to have more money for more staffing\n",
            "Yes, yeah, we do\n",
            "We have a lot of part-time instructors ,and you know, you spend a lot of time training your part-time instructors, and then they go off and get a full-time job, which is awesome\n",
            "You know, I'm very happy about that, and then new people come in, and you start the cycle over again\n",
            "I like them to get access to the academics they're teaching, whether it be mathematics, reading, or ESOL\n",
            "Whatever their instructional topic is, I also like them to have access to training on providing quality lessons, retaining students, and supporting students\n",
            "And I can give you a quick rundown\n",
            "The Alachua County Public Schools has an adult education program\n",
            "They mainly have ESOL, and I think they may be doing adult education in the jail in the Alachua County Detention Center\n",
            "And if you look on the Alachua County Library District Literacy Page, she has a list of all the adult literacy programs in the community, and I think that'll be real helpful\n",
            "And if you can't find it\n",
            "It's a little hidden on the library page\n",
            "Let me know, and I can\n",
            "I can send you the link\n",
            "A lot of it is just knowing people through the years, you know, and if you're invited to come, speak at a meeting or participate in a meeting, go, you know, invite people\n",
            "If people want to come over here, you know, invite, you know, have them come over\n",
            "I think it's just building relationships\n",
            "And I learned from probably my very first boss here that no time is ever wasted\n",
            "If you're going for a meeting somewhere, either in the community or at the state level\n",
            "You're always going to pick up something or meet somebody\n",
            "And so just trying to participate in different activities is important\n",
            "Well, of course, you always want to start young and have as many supports in the public schools as possible, whether they be public or charter schools\n",
            "We have a variety of offerings\n",
            "You want to make learning accessible and enjoyable for students, whether it be after-school programs or book reading activities\n",
            "The whole community should embrace improving literacy for all and work on it together in a fun and enjoyable way\n",
            "It should not be punitive; people shouldn't feel bad because they can't do it\n",
            "We all just want to improve together\n",
            "Well, probably any of the lower-income communities would be important\n",
            "A lot of families are stretched pretty thin trying to provide after-school support for their kids and may not have the education themselves to help once the students reach a certain level\n",
            "So, maybe let's all learn it together\n",
            "Additionally, any communities where English is not the first language are important\n",
            "If parents have basic English skills and the kids are struggling, that's another group of people to work with\n",
            "I think we should all be responsible\n",
            "It's almost like the whole community is responsible as far as the City and County Commission\n",
            "Us\n",
            "Plays a big part\n",
            "Alachua County School district, Santa Fe College, you know, and any of the career source any of the agencies\n",
            "Vocational rehabilitation, you know\n",
            "I think it's a community-wide effort\n",
            "You know, I don't know\n",
            "It might be just getting together and talking to start with\n",
            "Not just with an open floor, but maybe having someone take the lead to guide the conversation\n",
            "If this is a project you all are working on, maybe UF could take the lead and set up the parameters of the conversation and enhance it as you go along\n",
            "I also forgot to mention that faith-based organizations are very big and effective, especially in some of the lower-income communities\n",
            "My name is Bishop Christopher Stokes, and I am the executive director of the William A\n",
            "Stokes Community Center\n",
            "We're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit social service agency providing services to Micanopy, Alachua County, and the surrounding areas\n",
            "We provide food assistance\n",
            "We're actually in the process now of interviewing for a resource coordinator for our soon-to-open Family Resource Center\n",
            "We also provide after-school care in our Celebrating Success program and we also are one of the lead agencies working along with the City of Gainesville in the violence prevention in their Impact Gainesville, which is a violence prevention program\n",
            "I am the executive director\n",
            "I'm actually the founder and the executive director\n",
            "7 years\n",
            "Well, right now, we really could utilize more literacy tools\n",
            "Basically, what we're doing is just kinda helping along with wherever those individuals are at the with their reading ability\n",
            "And so we really could use more\n",
            "because what we're discovering is that we have kids, young people that are in our program that are literally grade 5 and up, 3rd-4th and up, that literally cannot read\n",
            "Not that just doesn't struggle with reading but cannot read\n",
            "And for me it baffles me how you can be in the 5th grade and can't read\n",
            "how you can be in the 6th grade and not read\n",
            "Or you're reading at a second or 3rd grade level\n",
            "And so there has to be more emphasis on our part\n",
            "But also finding the tools that we need  order to work on that\n",
            "I think I'm going to say at this point\n",
            "really, not only because we kind of got into it\n",
            "What I believe is a little too late\n",
            "When we first started out\n",
            "we were using materials that I think we had gotten through Dollar General cause they're really big on literacy\n",
            "But I wish that I could tell you that we have a strategy that that is working but right now I have to honestly say no, we don't\n",
            "Well, so we have in our Celebrating Success program, which is our after-school program, we have actually two teachers that are part of our after-school staff\n",
            "And we also have volunteers, some of which are retired teachers that do work along\n",
            "with our young people in the area of reading, and it really is for them\n",
            "I think every day, I have the conversation that this person can't read, or this person is struggling and you know, part of our model, you know, is that education is the new currency\n",
            "Our goal is to teach them to prepare, to be able to spend well\n",
            "But it's hard to kind of get them to do math when you can't read the directions or understand the directions\n",
            "And so, we are keenly aware of those struggles and needs, and so we're working on it\n",
            "I think that if there was a target area, I think one of the things is that connecting the needs which we'll be able to do now with the Family Resource Center is connecting families with resources to kind of help bridge those gaps\n",
            "Because what I'm also finding is that not only do we have young people who struggle with reading and literacy, but you have adults that have the same struggle\n",
            "And so how can we connect those bridge, those gaps\n",
            "And most of those are in the same household\n",
            "We have parents with kids that are in school, but parents that never finished high school\n",
            "And so I think what I would like to see is them to have more training on understanding family dynamics\n",
            "I think that would be it\n",
            "So the first thing that we have done is that we created a community assessment\n",
            "And we have gone out\n",
            "And I think, as of now, we've gotten about 100 responses and are looking at taking those responses and identifying what are the needs of our community\n",
            "When we look at rural Micanopy, what do they see\n",
            "Food was number one\n",
            "Transportation was number two, and medical was number three\n",
            "And then we go on\n",
            "And so the goal is, then now we would, we would build our program around providing those needs\n",
            "Also, connecting with the families that are a part of our community center\n",
            "Having them connect with that assessment as well\n",
            "To see how we can help bridge the gaps for those needs\n",
            "Micanopy as lovely as it is, it's a desert\n",
            "We've got plenty of trees, plenty of antiques\n",
            "There's probably not a better place to spend on Saturday, walking through a small town\n",
            "But it's great for the tourists\n",
            "But when we look at those needs—every Tuesday, we do a food giveaway, food distribution\n",
            "And we have over 150 people that come through every week, and we could do this every day and not see the same people\n",
            "And so there's that food desert\n",
            "We have medical resources that come out, and for a lot of them, that's the only doctor that they're able to see\n",
            "And so we just had a lady two weeks ago, who came and said, Bishop Stokes, I thank you because I haven't been able to get my blood levels, my blood sugars corrected in the last six months, and I came here and they figured out what I was doing wrong\n",
            "Because she couldn't get to Gainesville\n",
            "Transportation, literacy, all of those things all tie in together\n",
            "And so that’s what our goal is to address those needs and whatever else comes up as a result of their coming here\n",
            "Well, we are collaborating with Children's Trust and Partnership for Strong Families\n",
            "They are connecting with us to make this happen\n",
            "And, based on their expertise and Children's Trust's ability to fund, Partnership has also been doing this for years\n",
            "And so my outlook has always been that we do a lot of things in Alachua County\n",
            "But we don't necessarily connect with rural communities\n",
            "And so by the time that whatever dollars it is by the time it gets here we're, dealing with leftovers if we're dealing with any of it at all\n",
            "And so for the community center, our voice has always tried to be the voice for the rural communities\n",
            "What we're doing here in Micanopy is I want to be able to see this happen in every community, because every community is, you know, it may be different, but they're all the same\n",
            "And so that's where we are\n",
            "I think it's a combination of both\n",
            "I think that because we're rural and because we you know, one of the things that in those 7 years that we have been here, for 6 years and 4 months of those, We've done this with absolutely no funding\n",
            "We never received a dime from anyone\n",
            "What funded us\n",
            "What carried us was private donations, and what was left of my savings account\n",
            "But because this was important to me, because this was of value to our community, whatever it took part of it was we were a new program, and you know, you have no track record\n",
            "So you're not you're on notice and then we didn't have access to grant writers who could get us out there\n",
            "And so it wasn't until I want to say, the first part of January that we actually maybe last year is that we got our first grant\n",
            "Children's Trust\n",
            "And we had to fuel that process because we were initially not funded\n",
            "But I went back\n",
            "If the goal is to fund rural communities\n",
            "And then when you look at it, that one rural community is funded\n",
            "Then you did not meet your goal\n",
            "You may have funded other programs\n",
            "But you did not meet your goal\n",
            "And when we look at the county the programs that they had for funding\n",
            "you didn't fund a rural program so that didn't meet your goal either\n",
            "But Children's Trust really has been a strong collaborative partner for us\n",
            "And with Partnership for Strong Families coming on, But that may not be the story for Archer\n",
            "That may not be the story for Brooker\n",
            "I am working now with the town of Newberry about starting this same process\n",
            "I've talked to the mayor in Hawthorne about starting this same process\n",
            "Because just because you have a McDonald's, or just because you have a Dollar General, just because you have all of those establishments in your community still doesn't mean that you're meeting the needs of your community\n",
            "That's been my thing, lack of communication, and just not being noticed\n",
            "Because Gainesville gets the money because Gainesville has the people\n",
            "Gainesville has the connections\n",
            "Gainesville has the resources\n",
            "Newberry would get it because now they're a thriving area\n",
            "You know I'm in Alachua County\n",
            "But Micanopy, we're not getting those resources\n",
            "And if it were not for the community center and I really do mean this, there would be no resources\n",
            "Absolutely\n",
            "Right\n",
            "And one of the things is, I know that we are—I'm actually reaching for the needs assessment now, the summer report, because one of the things is when you look at rural communities and programs is that it's a the cycle now is grant reimbursement\n",
            "And so, for food, clothing, transportation, housing, utility\n",
            "and services for parents with children with special needs\n",
            "And literacy ranked in there as well\n",
            "And it was more adult education, GED classes that scored actually the highest for our area as related to needs\n",
            "But the piece is that in order to even apply for grants,\n",
            "you got to have some money because their grant reimbursement\n",
            "So if I had $100,000\n",
            "I don't think I would need $100,000 from you, because I got to spend 5,000, so you can give me 5,000 back\n",
            "And so I think that it's great for a city like Gainesville, because, you know programmatically, you got those kind of resources\n",
            "You got those kinds of agencies that can collaborate\n",
            "But when you're you know, you're a community, and the community center is great that we're getting these programs\n",
            "But, man, it's now where we're goanna get these dollars to, you know because you got to spend to get\n",
            "Combination thereof\n",
            "I think people coming in obviously, would be my first choice\n",
            "but also so that we don't become reliant on other people coming in is that we also have people who are trained in those strategies\n",
            "That can assist, because now\n",
            "It’s almost the same\n",
            "You're training us\n",
            "You're teaching us how to fish\n",
            "And so now you're not just bringing us the fish\n",
            "You're teaching us how to fish\n",
            "And so now what you have come in, what we have seen, you do\n",
            "What you have taught us to do now, not only can we service our own community, but now we also have a strategy that we can go and say, hey, Hawthorne, hey, Archer, hey, Reddick, hey, Sutra, have you all thought about implementing this program\n",
            "Let's help our community do it\n",
            "The gun violence is that kids are dying, and they're dying in other communities too\n",
            "So we can't just be satisfied with having this program here\n",
            "To be able to help those, I see a need for both\n",
            "But our primary would be outside coming in and helping\n",
